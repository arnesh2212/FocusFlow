Neurodiversity can be seen in every classroom, but not every teacher incorporates the needs of neurodiverse students into their pedagogy. Our neurodiverse students are often great at hiding how overwhelmed they are in the classroom. Often, students will present their anxiety through fidgeting, talking to themselves, or engaging in off-task behavior that soothes them, or in a variety of other ways that are specific to them.
As a neurodivergent teacher who has worked with neurodivergent students for many years, I’ve found that the following strategies help make sure these students feel less anxious and help them stay engaged in class. All of these strategies can be used and modified for K–12 students.
6 Tips to Help Neurodivergent Students Stay Engaged in Class
1. The first five minutes: I have used this strategy for a number of years, and it is always a great way to connect with students and learn about them as people. The first 5 minutes are spent walking around the classroom talking to students and asking them about anything not related to school: their day, local events, games they are playing, etc. Taking the first 5 minutes might seem tough at the start of the year, but neurodivergent students need to feel at ease in class, and being “seen” is the best way to start.
2. Relaxation: Another great way to help our neurodivergent students is to start class with some calming meditation. I move between relaxation exercises and the first-5-minutes approach throughout the week. Taking time to calm minds can really help our most anxious students. The hustle from one class to the next and possible school drama that can occur in the halls during passing time can cause any student, but especially neurodivergent ones, to have a hard time getting into the right frame of mind for class.
There are plenty of great apps and YouTube videos that can walk the class through a 5-minute breathing exercise. Spending the first 5 minutes focused only on relaxing is wonderful and works particularly well after lunch or physical education class.
3. Keep it moving: Give students the opportunity to move their bodies in class whenever possible. If you teach on a block schedule where students are in your class for over an hour, all students, and particularly neurodivergent ones, will need to move. You might see students get up and wander the room or constantly adjust their seat or dig in their bag. Tapping on the desk or rocking or leaning back in a chair is common as well.
At the beginning of the year, I have a conversation with all of my neurodivergent students, making sure they know they have a pass to get up and move as needed. If they have “the wiggles,” as I like to call it, they just need to make eye contact with me and look toward the door. I will nod and they will take a walk to the water fountain and come back. If a student can’t settle their body, they will not be able to focus in class. There are other methods to keep their body busy as well. Wobble chairs or exercise balls are great for students. Fidget toys can help as well.
4. Recognize DOOM boxes: DOOM boxes is a new term that has started to make the rounds on the internet. It is a name for something that people have been doing for decades. DOOM stands for Didn’t Organize, Only Moved. Neurodiverse people, especially those with ADHD, struggle with executive function, and that makes organization very difficult. The best example would be a student cleaning their desk by jamming everything in their backpack, or cleaning out their backpack by stuffing everything in their desk.
These messy places aren’t about students being messy but rather are about their inability to process the function of organization. Make class organizing time something for everyone. Clean out desks, lockers, and bags together so that students do not feel singled out or overwhelmed by the task at hand. Neurodiverse students want to be organized—they just don’t know how.
5. Words matter: As I’ve tried to support neurodiverse students, I’ve taken a close look at the language I use every day in class. A common phrase, “This should only take ___ minutes to complete,” can cause serious anxiety for a student if it takes them longer than the set time. Instead of giving a time frame, let the students work, and go around and check on those students who might struggle. Describing tasks as easy is another thing to avoid. If a student struggles, they will feel bad about themselves because it was supposed to be easy.
It is a common thing for teachers to want to relieve students’ stress by telling them that a task is easy or it will not take too long to complete so that they don’t feel overwhelmed. While that might work for some, it overwhelms others. Instead of “easy,” try saying, “This is something we have seen before.” During the school year, teachers will identify those students who need extra support, and it is important to communicate with them on the procedures that you have in place for them. Changing language takes time, but it can make a huge difference with students.
6. Rule of three: Everything I want students to do in class follows the “rule of three.” I make sure to tell the students what I want to happen, I write down on the board what I want to happen, and then I make sure to go to my students and talk with them about what needs to happen. This way, there have been three touch points on the class activity. The one-on-one touch point is always the most effective for my neurodiverse students, but the first two are great for the students who do not need to have the one-on-one talk. Over time, all of the students learn the routine of where the information can be found to do the work in class.

What Is ADHD?
ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is a medical condition. A person with ADHD has differences in brain development and brain activity that affect attention, the ability to sit still, and self-control. ADHD can affect a child at school, at home, and in friendships.

What Are the Signs of ADHD?
All kids struggle at times to pay attention, listen and follow directions, sit still, or wait their turn. But for kids with ADHD, the struggles are harder and happen more often.

Kids with ADHD can show signs in different areas. They might be:

Inattentive. Kids who are inattentive (easily distracted) have trouble focusing their attention, concentrating, and staying on task. They may not listen well to directions, may miss important details, and may not finish what they start. They may daydream or dawdle too much. They may seem absent-minded or forgetful, and lose track of their things.
Hyperactive. Kids who are hyperactive are fidgety, restless, and easily bored. They may have trouble sitting still, or staying quiet when needed. They may rush through things and make careless mistakes. They may climb, jump, or roughhouse when they shouldn't. Without meaning to, they may act in ways that disrupt others.
Impulsive. Kids who are impulsive act too quickly before thinking. They often interrupt, might push or grab, and find it hard to wait. They may do things without asking for permission, take things that aren't theirs, or act in ways that are risky. They may have emotional reactions that seem too intense for the situation.
Sometimes parents and teachers notice signs of ADHD when a child is very young. But it's normal for little kids to be distracted, restless, impatient, or impulsive — these things don't always mean that a child has ADHD.

Attention, activity, and self-control develop little by little, as children grow. Kids learn these skills with help from parents and teachers. But some kids don't get much better at paying attention, settling down, listening, or waiting. When these things continue and begin to cause problems at school, home, and with friends, it may be ADHD.

What Causes ADHD?
It's not clear what causes the brain differences of ADHD. There’s strong evidence that ADHD is mostly inherited. Many kids who have ADHD have a parent or relative with it. Kids also can be more at risk for it if they were born early, are exposed to environmental toxins, or their mothers used drugs during pregnancy.

ADHD is not caused by too much screen time, poor parenting, or eating too much sugar.

How Is ADHD Diagnosed?
If you think your child has ADHD, schedule a visit with their doctor. The doctor will do a checkup, including a vision and hearing check, to be sure something else isn't causing the symptoms.

To diagnose ADHD, doctors start by asking about a child's health, behavior, and activity. They talk with parents and kids about the things they have noticed. Your doctor might ask you to complete checklists about your child's behavior, and might ask you to give your child's teacher a checklist too.

After getting this information, doctors diagnose ADHD if it's clear that:

A child's trouble with paying attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity go beyond what's usual for their age.
The behaviors have been going on since the child was young.
The behaviors affect the child at school and at home.
A health check shows that another health or learning issue isn't causing the problems.
Many kids with ADHD also have learning problems, oppositional and defiant behaviors, or mood and anxiety problems. Doctors usually treat these along with the ADHD.

The doctor can refer you to a child psychologist or psychiatrist, if needed.

How Is ADHD Treated?
Treatment for ADHD usually includes:

Medicine. This activates the brain's ability to pay attention, slow down, and use more self-control.
Behavior therapy. Therapists can help kids develop the social, emotional, and planning skills that are lagging with ADHD.
Parent coaching. Through coaching, parents learn the best ways to respond to behavior problems that are part of ADHD.
School support. Teachers can help kids with ADHD do well and enjoy school more.
The right treatment helps ADHD improve. Parents and teachers can teach younger kids to get better at managing their attention, behavior, and emotions. As they grow older, kids should learn to improve their own attention and self-control.

When ADHD is not treated, it can be hard for kids to succeed. This may lead to low self-esteem, depression, oppositional behavior, school failure, risk-taking behavior, or family conflict.

How Can Parents Help?
If your child is diagnosed with ADHD:

Be involved. Learn all you can about ADHD. Follow the treatment your child's health care provider recommends. Go to all recommended therapy visits.
Give medicines safely. If your child is taking ADHD medicine, always give it at the recommended time and dose. Keep medicines in a safe place.
Work with your child's school. Ask teachers if your child should have an IEP or 504 plan. Meet often with teachers to find out how your child is doing. Work together to help your child do well
Parent with purpose and warmth. Learn what parenting approaches are best for a child with ADHD — and which can make ADHD worse. Talk openly and supportively about ADHD with your child. Focus on your child's strengths and positive qualities.
Connect with others for support and awareness. Join a support group like CHADD for ADHD to get updates on treatment and other information.
ADHD can improve when kids get treatment, eat healthy food, get enough sleep and exercise, and have supportive parents who know how to respond to ADHD.

Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.

Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate — autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. Some people still use the term "Asperger's syndrome," which is generally thought to be at the mild end of autism spectrum disorder.

Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood and eventually causes problems functioning in society — socially, in school and at work, for example. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year. A small number of children appear to develop normally in the first year, and then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age when they develop autism symptoms.

While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, intensive, early treatment can make a big difference in the lives of many children.

Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years.

Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning.

Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.

Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function.

Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.

Social communication and interaction
A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:

Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times
Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world
Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression
Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences
Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items
Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech
Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them
Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions
Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings
Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest
Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive
Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice
Patterns of behavior
A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs:

Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping
Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging
Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change
Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language
Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object
Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature
Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play
Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus
Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture
As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems.

When to see a doctor
Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books. But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development before age 2 years.

If you're concerned about your child's development or you suspect that your child may have autism spectrum disorder, discuss your concerns with your doctor. The symptoms associated with the disorder can also be linked with other developmental disorders.

Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions. Your doctor may recommend developmental tests to identify if your child has delays in cognitive, language and social skills, if your child:

Doesn't respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months
Doesn't mimic sounds or facial expressions by 9 months
Doesn't babble or coo by 12 months
Doesn't gesture — such as point or wave — by 14 months
Doesn't say single words by 16 months
Doesn't play "make-believe" or pretend by 18 months
Doesn't say two-word phrases by 24 months
Loses language skills or social skills at any age

Causes
Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role.

Genetics. Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.
Environmental factors. Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.
No link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder
One of the greatest controversies in autism spectrum disorder centers on whether a link exists between the disorder and childhood vaccines. Despite extensive research, no reliable study has shown a link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted due to poor design and questionable research methods.

Avoiding childhood vaccinations can place your child and others in danger of catching and spreading serious diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), measles or mumps.

Risk factors
The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising. It's not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting or a real increase in the number of cases, or both.

Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities, but certain factors increase a child's risk. These may include:

Your child's sex. Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are.
Family history. Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder.
Other disorders. Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use.
Extremely preterm babies. Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder.
Parents' ages. There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link.
Complications
Problems with social interactions, communication and behavior can lead to:

Problems in school and with successful learning
Employment problems
Inability to live independently
Social isolation
Stress within the family
Victimization and being bullied

Prevention
There's no way to prevent autism spectrum disorder, but there are treatment options. Early diagnosis and intervention is most helpful and can improve behavior, skills and language development. However, intervention is helpful at any age. Though children usually don't outgrow autism spectrum disorder symptoms, they may learn to function well.
At a certain time, in the human brain there will be thousands of chemical reactions taking place and many chemicals are responsible for transmitting information in the brain. So what is the hypothesis of a chemical imbalance in the brain? How does it affect the body?
1. What is a chemical imbalance in the brain and how does it affect the body?
A chemical imbalance in the brain is thought to occur when there is too much or too little of certain chemicals, called neurotransmitters, in the brain. Neurotransmitters are natural chemicals that help facilitate communication between your nerve cells. Examples include norepinephrine and serotonin.
When these transmitters are disturbed or in other words, there is a chemical imbalance in the brain leading to disturbances in the communication of information between regions. These transmissions become erroneous and cause mental disorders. Depending on the extent of this imbalance, other mental disorders such as anxiety, depression or, more seriously, can cause schizophrenia.
It is often said that mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. The pathogenesis of this condition is also known as the chemical imbalance hypothesis or the chemical imbalance theory.
To be able to conclude whether psychotic symptoms are caused by chemical imbalance, the answer is not clear because there is quite a lot of controversy surrounding this theory.
In fact, scientists have largely rejected this hypothesis. The researchers argue that the chemical imbalance hypothesis is purely hypothetical and there is no scientific evidence to support this hypothesis. This theory does not address the true complexity of mental disorders.
In other words, mental health conditions are not simply caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, but many other things.
2. What are the symptoms of a chemical imbalance in the brain?
Scientists in the late 1950s first proposed the idea that mental health conditions are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Research at this time has largely focused on the role of brain chemicals in depression and anxiety disorders.
These researchers hypothesize that lower than normal levels of neurotransmitters can lead to symptoms such as:
Feelings of sadness, helplessness, depression or emptiness Overeating or boredom eating Insomnia or sleeping too much Restlessness Irritability Feelings of death or impending danger Lack of energy Being alienated from others Feeling numb or lacking in empathy Mood swings Intent to harm oneself or others Unable to do usual daily activities Hearing voices in your head Abuse of alcohol or drugs Inability to concentrate

3. What causes a person to have an imbalance of chemicals in the brain?
The origins and causes of chemical imbalances in the brain are still unclear. Researchers believe that genetic factors, as well as environmental and social factors (stress or trauma), also play a role in this chemical imbalance.
This hypothesis has not been proven and is often cited only as a speculation for mental health conditions. It can be said that this condition is caused by an imbalance of neurotransmitters between nerve cells in the brain.
For example, major depressive disorder is thought to be related to too low serotonin levels in the brain. But this hypothesis does not explain why these chemicals become unbalanced and the source of the imbalance.
As reported by Harvard Medical School, there can be millions of different chemical reactions happening in the brain at any given time. These chemical reactions make up our brain's overall mood and emotions. And we would have no way of knowing if a patient really had a chemical imbalance in the brain at a given time.
The most common evidence supporting the chemical imbalance hypothesis is the effectiveness of antidepressants. These drugs work to increase the amount of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in the brain.
However, just because a patient's emotions may be heightened with medications that increase brain chemicals doesn't mean that a deficiency in that chemical is causing symptoms of depression in the first place. Low serotonin levels can also be just another symptom of depression, not the cause.
Many patients with depression do not improve after being treated with these drugs. Studies show that currently on the market antidepressant drugs are only effective in about 50% of patients with depression.
4. Is there a test to identify chemical imbalances in the brain?
For a chemical imbalance in the brain, there is no reliable test to determine if the condition is present. Tests that use urine, saliva, or blood to measure neurotransmitters in the brain may not be very accurate.
Studies have proven that not all neurotransmitters are produced in the brain. Tests currently on the market will not be able to distinguish between the levels of neurotransmitters in your brain and the levels of neurotransmitters in your body.
Also, the levels of neurotransmitters in your body and brain change constantly and rapidly. This makes such tests unreliable.
5. Diagnosing mental disorders related to chemical imbalances in the brain
A mental health condition that is not diagnosed by chemotransmitter tests. The patient's treatment plan will also not be affected by such tests.
A health care provider may order blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. These causes can also trigger symptoms of a mental health condition.
If no underlying illness is found, you may be referred to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. They will perform a psychological assessment.
The doctor will ask you a series of questions related to:
Thoughts Emotions Eating and sleeping habits Daily activities

6. How are chemical imbalances in the brain treated?
There are several medications available that are thought to work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain. These drugs change the levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, or norepinephrine. Some work on a combination of these two chemicals.
Medications may include:
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs block the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Certain medications, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa). Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This class of drugs includes duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). SNRIs work by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, resulting in increased levels of these two chemicals in the brain. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Examples include imipramine (Tofranil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor). TCAs limit the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin. Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). NDRIs, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), help reduce the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs work by preventing the breakdown of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Some drugs, such as isocarboxazid (Marplan) and phenelzine (Nardil), are not as popular as other antidepressants. When it comes to mental health, there are many factors that influence it. For some people, depression and other mental health conditions are episodic, meaning symptoms come and go. Medicines can help control your symptoms, but the disorder can take a long time to go into remission. Symptoms may also recur later.
In the treatment of mental health conditions with medication, communication therapy techniques are also an effective treatment. Psychotherapy helps transform your thinking and behavior into healthier patterns. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help prevent depression from coming back when you're feeling better.
7. Prospects in the treatment of mental disorders related to chemical imbalances in the brain
A mental health condition is more than simply having a chemical imbalance in the brain. There is little evidence to prove that an imbalance in certain brain chemicals is the cause of any kind of mental health condition.
If you are facing signs and symptoms of a mental health condition, you should see a health care provider for a diagnosis.
Once diagnosed, you may need to try different medicines or combinations of drugs before you find the right one for you.
Your doctor will need to consider many factors involved when determining a treatment plan. Patience is a deciding factor. Once you find the right treatment, most people will improve their symptoms within 6 weeks.
In summary, chemical imbalance in the brain is a condition that can be improved if detected early and intervened in time. Therefore, it is extremely important to have regular health exams to detect early signs of chemical imbalance in the brain. Currently, Vinmec is implementing a lot of periodic health checkup packages suitable for each age, gender and individual needs of customers with a very favorable price policy, including:

Neurodivergent is a nonmedical term that describes people whose brains develop or work differently for some reason. This means the person has different strengths and struggles from people whose brains develop or work more typically. While some people who are neurodivergent have medical conditions, it also happens to people where a medical condition or diagnosis hasn’t been identified.

The term “neurodivergent” describes people whose brain differences affect how their brain works. That means they have different strengths and challenges from people whose brains don’t have those differences. The possible differences include medical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions. The possible strengths include better memory, being able to mentally picture three-dimensional (3D) objects easily, the ability to solve complex mathematical calculations in their head, and many more.

Neurodivergent isn’t a medical term. Instead, it’s a way to describe people using words other than “normal” and “abnormal.” That’s important because there’s no single definition of “normal” for how the human brain works.

The word for people who aren’t neurodivergent is “neurotypical.” That means their strengths and challenges aren't affected by any kind of difference that changes how their brains work.

Why does this term exist?
The term “neurodivergent” came from the related term “neurodiversity.” Judy Singer, an Australian sociologist, coined the word “neurodiversity” in 1998 to recognize that everyone’s brain develops in a unique way.

Like a person’s fingerprints, no two brains — not even those of identical twins — are exactly the same. Because of that, there’s no definition of “normal” capabilities for the human brain.

For most areas of modern medicine, defining what’s normal is critical. In many circumstances, healthcare providers determine a person’s health based on the yes-or-no question, “Is this normal?” Depending on the answer, a person is either sick or well based on symptoms they do or don’t have or things they can or can’t do.

An example of this in everyday life would be comparing the following two people with a special talent for drawing.

Person #1: A 12-year-old child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who struggles in social situations. The child’s main ASD-related issues are social problems, unusually high interest in drawing and being strictly dependent on a daily routine. The child is naturally better at drawing without taking classes or accumulating experience.
Person #2: A 40-year-old neurotypical adult. The adult learned to draw at the age of 17, and their talent took hard work and time to develop. They’re very social and make friends easily.
No one would consider the adult abnormal or defective because they can’t paint as well as the child. Likewise, autism spectrum disorder is a condition that can take many different forms, many of which happen in people who don’t have ASD.

Describing the child as neurodivergent acknowledges that they’re “differently abled.” Neurodiversity means it’s natural for both the adult and the child to develop differently and have their own abilities and struggles.

Is being neurodivergent a disability?
Some neurodivergent people struggle because of systems or processes that don’t give them a chance to show off their strengths or that create new or more intense challenges for them.

Example #1: Many people who are neurodivergent struggle in social situations, which can make it hard to find work because they struggle during job interviews. However, they can still get the job if the hiring process emphasizes their abilities, such as screening potential hires with a skills test. Once on the job, their attention to detail means they’re an outstanding accountant or record-keeper because they can easily process data that others might find more tedious.
Example #2: Some who are neurodivergent struggle in noisy environments or situations. That means a busy office can feel overwhelming to them. However, a pair of noise-canceling headphones might give them the quiet they need to make them the most productive person on their team because one of their strengths is the ability to focus on their work intensely.
In both examples, accommodations helped the person overcome their particular struggle. For someone with a disability, an accommodation is a way to accept that they’re different or have challenges, and then give them a tool or a way to succeed. For the people who are neurodivergent in the examples above, the accommodations were the hiring process and the headphones.

Accommodations for people with disabilities isn’t a new idea. Some examples include:

Physical disabilities: Ramps and entrances with automatic doors for those in wheelchairs.
Sensory disabilities: Crosswalks with a loud tone for those who have vision problems to let them know it’s safe to cross the street.
Why use the term neurodivergent to describe people?
Some people oppose the idea of neurodiversity as being about differences instead of deficits. Many who take that stance say they’re against it because some who are neurodivergent have true medical conditions that need treatment.

However, research shows that knowing about the idea of neurodiversity doesn’t mean people who are neurodivergent ignore or deny that they have struggles. Instead, the research shows people who know about the idea of being neurodivergent use that knowledge to adapt and help them succeed.

Experts’ research also shows words and language related to neurodiversity make a difference in how people live. People who are neurodivergent and learn that it means they’re different — not sick or defective — are more likely to be happier and aim higher in their careers.

An example of this is someone who has dyslexia. People with that condition struggle to read because their brain doesn’t process written language like the brain of someone without dyslexia. However, people with dyslexia usually have brains that are better at processing or mentally picturing 3D objects. That makes them much faster at identifying optical illusions, and they have a natural talent for jobs like graphic design and arts, engineering and more.

Possible Causes
What are the symptoms of being neurodivergent?
“Neurodivergent” isn’t a medical term, condition or diagnosis. People who are neurodivergent have differences in the way their brain works. This is still true even for people with the same medical diagnosis. That means people with very different signs and symptoms can still have the same diagnosis.

What conditions can a neurodivergent person have?
People who identify themselves as neurodivergent typically have one or more of the conditions or disorders listed below. However, since there aren’t any medical criteria or definitions of what it means to be neurodivergent, other conditions also can fall under this term as well. People with these conditions may also choose not to identify themselves as neurodivergent.

Some of the conditions that are most common among those who describe themselves as neurodivergent include:

Autism spectrum disorder (this includes what was once known as Asperger’s syndrome).
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
DiGeorge syndrome.
Down syndrome.
Dyscalculia (difficulty with math).
Dysgraphia (difficulty with writing).
Dyslexia (difficulty with reading).
Dyspraxia (difficulty with coordination).
Intellectual disabilities.
Mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and more.
Prader-Willi syndrome.
Sensory processing disorders.
Social anxiety (a specific type of anxiety disorder).
Tourette syndrome.
Williams syndrome.

How can I find out if I’m neurodivergent or if my child is neurodivergent?
The first step to finding out if you, or someone you care for, are neurodivergent is to talk to your healthcare provider. They can refer you to a specialist or other providers who can determine if you have a medical disorder, condition or other brain-related difference that might explain why your brain works differently.

Is it possible to prevent, treat or cure being neurodivergent?
Neurodiversity refers to the unique way that each person’s brain develops. That means it’s not preventable, treatable or curable.

Some of the conditions that cause a person to be neurodivergent are manageable. If a specialist or other healthcare provider diagnoses you (or someone you care for) with a condition like those mentioned above, they can also talk to you about resources for people with that condition. There’s a wide range of possible management options, therapy programs and more.

For some people, such as those with ADHD, behavioral therapy and medication can positively affect their quality of life. For others, therapy programs can help you “play to your strengths,” meaning they show you how to make the most out of your abilities. They can also show you how to adapt to your challenges, minimizing their interference in your life.

Can people who are neurodivergent be successful?
Yes, many people who are neurodivergent are accomplished and successful.

More and more people who are neurodivergent are talking about their experiences. Some examples of famous and successful people who are neurodivergent include:

Animal scientist and author Temple Grandin.
Oscar-winning actor Sir Anthony Hopkins.
Musician and singer Florence Welch.
Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg.
Experts also believe several accomplished historical figures were neurodivergent based on evidence from their lives. Those include:

Nobel Prize-winning physicist and chemist Marie Curie.
Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Albert Einstein.
Artist Vincent Van Gogh.
Inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla.
Author F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Business leaders also have a growing understanding of the value of being neurodivergent. In 2017, the magazine Harvard Business Review published “Neurodiversity as a competitive advantage.” The article details the benefits of hiring people who are neurodivergent and why more businesses are doing so.

That same article noted that several major national and international corporations have hiring processes that can accommodate people who are neurodivergent. Those corporations include some of the largest names in information technology, the automotive industry, the banking sector and more.

Where can I learn more about what it means to be neurodivergent?
People who are neurodivergent often excel at communicating in online spaces. That’s because nonverbal communication — such as eye contact, facial expressions and body language — doesn’t have to be a part of online interaction. Experts often compare computers and other digital devices to prosthetics for those with difficulties in social communication.

There are several online spaces where groups of people who are neurodivergent gather, exchange information, discuss their experiences and struggles, and offer advice and resources to each other. Some of the most popular spaces are in plain sight, with neurodivergent communities, groups and information-sharing on some of the most popular websites and social media platforms.

What are some things I can do to support someone who is neurodivergent?
There are many things people can do to be supportive of neurodivergent individuals. Some of the most important things you should keep in mind include:

Listen. People who are neurodivergent may feel misunderstood or left out. Be willing to listen to them. Let them know you hear them and respect them and their choices.
Communicate in ways that help them. Sometimes, people who are neurodivergent prefer written communication such as instant messaging, texting or emails over a phone call or face-to-face conversation. Give them the time and tools they need to communicate.
Avoid value-based labels. Experts recommend against using the terms “high-functioning” and “low-functioning” to describe conditions like autism. They often assume a person’s level of function based on how much they behave like someone who’s neurotypical.
No two neurodivergent people are the same. The personalities and preferences of neurodivergent people can be widely different, even when they have the same underlying condition.
Don’t assume that anyone is incapable or unintelligent. People who are neurodivergent often have conditions or preferences that make them stand out or appear different.
Treat everyone with respect. You can “normalize” and provide others with accommodations in a way that honors their human dignity.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

“Neurodiversity” is a word used to explain the unique ways people’s brains work. While everyone’s brain develops similarly, no two brains function just alike. Being neurodivergent means having a brain that works differently from the average or “neurotypical” person. This may be differences in social preferences, ways of learning, ways of communicating and/or ways of perceiving the environment. Because of this, a neurodivergent person has different struggles and unique strengths. People who are neurodivergent can benefit from education and programs that help them develop their strengths using them to their benefit to live happy, healthy lives.
What is DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)?
DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a genetic condition that can affect many parts of your body and causes heart abnormalities, an impaired immune system and developmental delays. If you’re diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome, you’re missing a small piece of chromosome 22. Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome can range from mild to severe. The most severe symptoms can be life-threatening.

Who does DiGeorge syndrome affect?
DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) can affect anyone since 90% of cases occur as a result of a random deletion on chromosome 22. This happens when the egg and sperm meet in the early stages of fetal development. The rate of occurrence is unpredictable. This condition isn’t caused by something the parents did before or during pregnancy.

In 10% of cases, some people can inherit 22q11.2 deletion syndrome from one parent who has the condition (autosomal dominant). Only one copy of the chromosome from one parent is necessary for the child to inherit the condition.

How common is DiGeorge syndrome?
DiGeorge syndrome isn’t common. About 1 in 4,000 people in the U.S. receive a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome diagnosis annually. Some studies suggest that this estimate could be more common since the condition is underdiagnosed.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome?
Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. Some people might not experience any symptoms of the condition but will have changes to their genetic code. The condition can affect several parts of your body.

The classic features are problems with the heart, underdeveloped thymus and decreased calcium levels.

Heart symptoms
Heart growth and function abnormalities can affect people diagnosed with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and cause the following conditions:

Tetralogy of Fallot.
Truncus arteriosus.
Underdeveloped aorta.
Ventricular septal defects.
Congenital heart disease.
Symptoms that affect your heart can be life-threatening.

Symptoms that affect your brain
Symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can affect the function and development of your brain and could include:

Anxiety and/or depression.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Autism spectrum disorder.
Challenges with cognitive development and behavior.
Developmental delays, including fine motor skills, speech and language.
Schizophrenia.
Seizures.
Immune system symptoms
A deletion on chromosome 22 can cause symptoms that affect the function of your immune system. Your immune system is responsible for fighting infections and keeping you healthy. Symptoms could include:

A high risk of getting an infection.
Low production of white blood cells that fight infections (T-lymphocytes).
An underdeveloped thymus that doesn’t produce enough antibodies to fight bacteria and viruses.
Physical and body system symptoms
A deletion of part of chromosome 22 can cause physical symptoms that include:

Hearing loss.
Spine curvature (scoliosis).
Vision loss.
Testes don’t descend (cryptorchidism).
Small adenoids and missing or small tonsils.
Breathing difficulties.
Lower-than-normal levels of calcium in your blood (hypocalcemia).
Kidney structure and function abnormalities.
Endocrine system (hormone) function abnormalities.
Feeding difficulties during infancy.
Facial features
DiGeorge syndrome can also cause unique facial features that include:

Hooded eyelids.
Flat cheeks.
A prominent or bulbous nose.
An underdeveloped chin.
Ears with attached lobes.
Cleft lip and palate.
What causes DiGeorge syndrome?
A missing part of chromosome 22 causes DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome). Each chromosome holds thousands of genes. Genes are responsible for providing the instruction manual to help your body grow and function. The term “22q11.2” gives the specific location on the chromosome where genes are missing; segment 11 on the long arm (q) of chromosome 22. When you’re missing potentially thousands of genes, your body doesn’t have the instructions you need to develop as expected and you’ll experience symptoms.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?
DiGeorge syndrome can be detected prenatally based upon prenatal ultrasound results and amniocentesis.

If not detected prior to delivery, your healthcare providers will likely diagnose DiGeorge syndrome soon after your child is born. They may request special tests if they suspect the condition based on symptoms such as seizures, unique facial characteristics or blood tests that show low calcium levels.

What tests diagnose DiGeorge syndrome?
Your healthcare provider will review your family medical history and the following tests to diagnose 22q11.2 deletion syndrome:

Genetic testing: Your provider will study a small sample of blood from your newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.
Imaging tests: X-ray and CT scan tests provide images of the inside of your child’s body. The images help identify growth abnormalities in your child’s heart and other organs.
Physical exam: Providers examine your child’s face, ears and eyes for characteristics of the condition.
Management and Treatment
How is DiGeorge syndrome treated?
Treatment for DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) varies for each person and depends on what symptoms affect your body. Treatment could include:

Antibiotic medications to treat infections.
Calcium supplements to treat low calcium levels.
Ear tubes or hearing aids to improve hearing.
Occupational therapy to improve developmental delays.
Hormone replacement therapy to treat endocrine abnormalities.
Surgery to repair internal organ symptoms or a cleft palate.
Medicine to reduce seizures or neurological conditions.
Special education programs to address learning challenges in school.
Your provider will immediately treat symptoms that could be life-threatening after a diagnosis, especially symptoms that affect your child’s heart, to prevent complications.

Prevention
How can I prevent DiGeorge syndrome?
You can’t prevent DiGeorge syndrome since it’s a genetic condition. If you plan on becoming pregnant and want to learn about your risk of having a child with a genetic condition, talk to your provider about genetic testing.

If you’re pregnant and have a family member with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, ask your provider about prenatal and newborn screenings. These tests can reveal signs of the condition, such as heart and kidney abnormalities, before your baby is born. Detecting the condition early can help you and your provider prepare for your baby’s care after they’re born.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have DiGeorge syndrome?
DiGeorge syndrome is a lifelong condition without a cure. Your outlook depends on the severity of your symptoms. Some of your symptoms could be life-threatening, especially if they affect your heart. With ongoing treatment and support, adults diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome live active and fulfilling lives with limited interruption from their condition.

What is the life expectancy of a person diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome?
Most people diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome have a normal life expectancy with mild symptoms. Severe symptoms can lead to a shortened life expectancy without treatment.

Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider?
In most cases, your provider will diagnose DiGeorge syndrome when your baby is born or during early childhood checkups. Contact your provider if your child shows signs or symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome.

If your child diagnosed with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome has trouble breathing or has a seizure, call 911 or visit the emergency room immediately.

What questions should I ask my doctor?
If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, you may want to ask your doctor:

What is the outlook for this condition?
How will it affect my child’s daily life?
What does treatment involve?
What complications should I look out for?
Is there a support group where I can find other families dealing with this condition?
A note from Cleveland Clinic

It may be overwhelming to learn that your newborn has a genetic condition like DiGeorge syndrome. Remember that their diagnosis isn’t a result of something you did as their parent, rather their genetic instruction manual didn’t get put together completely when they were developing. Talk to your provider about genetic counseling to learn more about your child’s diagnosis and how you can help them grow.
Schizophrenia involves a disconnection from reality, including hallucinations and delusions. It also affects your ability to recognize your symptoms. It’s a severe condition, but it’s treatable.
Schizophrenia is a psychiatric condition that has severe effects on your physical and mental well-being. It disrupts how your brain works, interfering with things like your thoughts, memory, senses and behaviors. As a result, you may struggle in many parts of your day-to-day life. Untreated schizophrenia often disrupts your relationships (professional, social, romantic and otherwise). It can also cause you to have trouble organizing your thoughts, and you might behave in ways that put you at risk for injuries or other illnesses.
What are the types of schizophrenia?
Psychiatrists once referred to different types of schizophrenia, like paranoid schizophrenia and catatonic schizophrenia. But the types weren’t very useful in diagnosing or treating schizophrenia. Instead, experts now view schizophrenia as a spectrum of conditions, including:

Schizotypal personality disorder (which also falls under the category of personality disorders).
Delusional disorder.
Brief psychotic disorder.
Schizophreniform disorder.
Schizoaffective disorder.
Other schizophrenia spectrum disorders (specified or unspecified). This diagnosis allows healthcare providers to diagnose unusual variations of schizophrenia.
Who does it affect?
Schizophrenia starts between ages 15 and 25 for men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) and between 25 and 35 for women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). It also tends to affect men and women in equal numbers. About 20% of new schizophrenia cases occur in people over age 45. These cases tend to happen more in men and people AMAB.

Schizophrenia in children is rare but possible. When schizophrenia does start in childhood, it’s usually more severe and harder to treat.

How common is schizophrenia?
Schizophrenia is a somewhat common condition. Worldwide, it affects 221 in every 100,000 people.

Many people with schizophrenia can’t recognize that they have symptoms of schizophrenia. But those around you might. These are the five main symptoms of schizophrenia

Delusions: These are false beliefs that you hold even when there’s plenty of evidence that those beliefs are wrong. For example, you might think that someone is controlling what you think, say or do.
Hallucinations: You still think you can see, hear, smell, touch or taste things that don’t exist, like hearing voices.
Disorganized or incoherent speaking: You may have trouble organizing your thoughts while speaking. This might look like trouble staying on topic, or your thoughts might be so jumbled that people can’t understand you.
Disorganized or unusual movements: You might move differently than people around you expect. For example, you may turn around a lot for no clear reason, or you might not move much at all.
Negative symptoms: These refer to a reduction or loss of your ability to do things as expected. For example, you might stop making facial expressions, or speak with a flat, emotionless voice. Negative symptoms also include a lack of motivation, especially when you don’t want to socialize or do things you ordinarily enjoy.
Because of these symptoms, you might:

Feel suspicious, paranoid or scared.
Not care about your hygiene and appearance.
Experience depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
Use alcohol, nicotine, prescription medications or recreational drugs to try to ease your symptoms.
What causes schizophrenia?
There’s no one single cause of schizophrenia. Experts suspect schizophrenia happens for different reasons. The three main reasons include:

Imbalances in chemical signals your brain uses for cell-to-cell communication.
Brain development problems before birth.
Loss of connections between different areas of your brain.
What are the risk factors of schizophrenia?
While there aren’t any confirmed causes of schizophrenia, there are risk factors for developing the condition:

Environment: Many factors in the world around you can increase your risk of developing schizophrenia. Being born during the winter increases your risk slightly. Certain illnesses that affect your brain, including infections and autoimmune diseases (where your immune system attacks part of your body), can also increase your risk. Extreme stress for long periods can also play a role in developing it.
Development and birth circumstances: How you developed before you were born plays a role in schizophrenia. The risk of having schizophrenia goes up if your birthing parent had gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, malnutrition or a vitamin D deficiency while pregnant with you. The risk also increases if you were underweight at birth or if there were complications during your birth (like if you were born via an emergency cesarean section).
Recreational drug use: Schizophrenia is linked with the use of certain recreational drugs, especially in larger amounts and earlier in life. The connection between heavy marijuana (cannabis) use as a teenager is one of the best-studied of these links. But experts aren’t sure if marijuana use is a direct cause of schizophrenia or if it’s just a contributing factor.
Is schizophrenia genetic?

Experts haven’t found one specific cause of schizophrenia, so they can’t say for sure if genetics cause schizophrenia. But if you have a family history of schizophrenia — especially a parent or sibling with it — you have a much higher risk of developing this condition.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is schizophrenia diagnosed?
Your (or your loved one’s) healthcare provider can diagnose schizophrenia or its related disorders based on a combination of questions they ask, the symptoms you describe or by observing your actions. They’ll also ask questions to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. They then compare what they find to the criteria required for a schizophrenia diagnosis.

According to the DSM-5, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the following:

At least two of the five main symptoms.
You’ve had symptoms for at least one month.
Your symptoms impact your ability to work or your relationships (friendly, romantic, professional or otherwise).
What tests will be done to diagnose this condition?
There aren’t any diagnostic tests for schizophrenia. But healthcare providers may run tests to rule out other conditions before diagnosing schizophrenia. The most likely types of tests include:

Imaging tests. Healthcare providers will often use computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging tests to rule out problems like stroke, brain injuries, tumors and other changes to your brain structure.
Blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (spinal tap) tests. These tests look for chemical changes in bodily fluids that might explain changes in your behavior. They can rule out heavy metal toxicity or other causes of poisoning, infections and more.
Brain activity testing. An electroencephalogram (EEG) detects and records the electrical activity in your brain. This test can help rule out conditions like epilepsy.
Management and Treatment
Can schizophrenia be cured?
Schizophrenia isn’t curable, but it’s often treatable. In a small percentage of cases, people can recover from schizophrenia entirely. But this isn’t a cure because there’s no way of knowing who will relapse and who won’t. Because of that, experts consider those who recover from this condition “in remission.”

How is schizophrenia treated?
Treating schizophrenia usually involves a combination of medication, therapy and self-management techniques. These include:

Antipsychotics. These medications block how your brain uses certain chemicals for cell-to-cell communication.
Other medications. Your healthcare provider might also prescribe other medications to symptoms that happen alongside or because of your schizophrenia symptoms. They might also prescribe medications to help reduce side effects of antipsychotic medications such as tremors.
Psychotherapy. Talk therapy methods like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you cope with and manage your condition. Long-term therapy can also help with secondary problems alongside schizophrenia, such as anxiety, depression or substance use issues.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). If other treatments don’t work, your provider may recommend ECT. This treatment involves using an electrical current applied to your scalp, which then stimulates certain parts of your brain. The stimulation causes a brief seizure, which can help improve brain function if you have severe depression, agitation and other problems. If you have ECT, you receive anesthesia. You’ll be asleep for this procedure and won’t feel any pain.
How soon after treatment will I feel better?
Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you how long it’ll take for medication and therapy to work, as different medications take different amounts of time before their effects are noticeable. Your provider can also tell you about other treatment options that might help if the first treatments don’t work well.

Prevention
How can I reduce my risk or prevent this condition?
Because experts still don’t know why schizophrenia happens, it’s impossible to prevent it or reduce your risk of it happening.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have this condition?
Schizophrenia is a condition that varies greatly from person to person. You may struggle with work, relationships and self-care. But with treatment, you may be able to work, care for yourself and have fulfilling relationships.

This condition also often affects people in cycles. That means you can go through periods when the condition flares up and your symptoms get much worse. Then, you may have a time when your symptoms improve but don’t completely go away.

Despite how serious this condition is, treatment does make it possible to live with the condition and minimize how it affects your life.

What’s the outlook for this condition?
Schizophrenia itself isn’t a deadly condition. But its effects can lead to dangerous or harmful behaviors. About one-third of people with schizophrenia have symptoms that worsen over time. That can happen because your symptoms don’t respond to treatment, or you have trouble following treatment plans closely enough to manage the condition. About 10% of people with schizophrenia die by suicide.

Other people respond to treatment. But they still have periods where symptoms return and worsen. They might also have lingering problems, like trouble focusing or thinking, because of earlier episodes of this condition.

Living With
How do I take care of myself?
If you have schizophrenia, you should do the following to help care for yourself and manage your condition:

Take medications as prescribed. One of the most critical things you can do is take your medications. If you have schizophrenia, you shouldn’t stop your medication without talking to your healthcare provider. Discuss any concerns or side effects with your provider to find one that both works well for you and has minimal or no side effects.
See your healthcare provider as recommended. Your healthcare provider will set up a schedule for you to see them. These visits are especially important to help with managing your condition.
Don’t ignore or avoid symptoms. You’re more likely to respond to treatment and have a good outcome with early diagnosis and medical care.
Avoid alcohol and recreational drug use. Alcohol and drug use can make schizophrenia symptoms worse and can lead to other issues. This includes using prescription medications in a way other than prescribed.
Consider seeking support. Organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness can offer resources and information that can help.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
You should see your healthcare provider as recommended. You should also see them if you notice a change in your symptoms, like if they get worse even if you’re taking your medication. You can see your provider if the side effects of your medication cause disruptions in your life, as well. Your healthcare provider can sometimes recommend alternative medications or treatments that might better treat your condition without causing those same effects.

When should I go to the ER?
If you have thoughts of harming yourself or others, call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (U.S.). If you feel like you’re in immediate danger of harming yourself, call 911, your local emergency services number or go to the nearest emergency room.

Additional Common Questions
What can I do if a loved one shows signs of schizophrenia?
If you notice a loved one showing signs of schizophrenia or a related condition, you can try helping them by doing the following:

Ask how you can help. Listening and offering your help keeps a line of communication open and helps them feel connected to others.
Encourage them to see someone who can help. Treatment for schizophrenia, especially medication, can improve a person’s symptoms and help them recognize what’s real and what isn’t.
Don’t judge or argue. Avoid judging them or arguing with them about what’s real and what isn’t, even if you have evidence. People experiencing hallucinations or delusions usually don’t respond to evidence because they can’t tell what’s real and what isn’t.
Stay calm. If they’re agitated or angry, don’t raise your voice, and try to make the area around you as calm and quiet as possible. You should also make sure they don’t feel trapped or otherwise threatened.
Get help in emergencies. People with schizophrenia are much more likely to die by suicide. Call for help if they talk about thoughts of harming themselves or others.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

Schizophrenia can be a frightening condition for you and your loved ones. Despite stereotypes, this isn’t a condition where any thought of recovery or living a happy, fulfilling life is impossible. If you think you have symptoms of schizophrenia, it’s important to talk to a healthcare provider as soon as you can. Their job is to help you, and healthcare providers — especially those who specialize in mental health conditions like schizophrenia — have the training to help you not feel judged, ashamed or embarrassed.

If you notice a loved one struggling with symptoms of psychosis or schizophrenia, encourage them gently and supportively to get care. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in helping people recover and manage this condition.
What is Down syndrome?
Down syndrome is a genetic condition where people are born with an extra chromosome. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes within each cell in their body, for a total of 46. A person diagnosed with Down syndrome has an extra copy of chromosome 21, which means their cells contain 47 total chromosomes instead of 46. This changes the way their brain and body develop.

Who does Down syndrome affect?
Down syndrome can affect anyone. It’s a genetic condition, and it doesn’t happen as a result of something that the parents did before or during pregnancy. The majority of Down syndrome cases happen randomly (sporadically). People don’t usually inherit Down syndrome in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern during conception when the egg and sperm meet.

What are the risk factors for Down syndrome?
Research is ongoing to learn more about the risk factors of Down syndrome. Studies suggest that the risk of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome increases as the birthing parent ages. Women or people assigned female at birth (AFAB) who are 35 or older are more likely to have a child diagnosed with Down syndrome or another type of genetic condition. Since people AFAB younger than 35 have higher fertility rates, most babies with Down syndrome are born to people under 35.

How common is Down syndrome?
Down syndrome is the most common chromosome-related condition in the United States. An estimated 6,000 babies are born with the condition in the U.S. every year, which equals about 1 in every 700 babies. There are about 200,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with Down syndrome.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of Down syndrome?
Down syndrome causes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Not all people with Down syndrome have all of these symptoms. Symptoms and their severity are different from person to person.

Physical signs of Down syndrome
Physical signs of Down syndrome are usually present at birth and become more apparent as your baby grows. They can include:

A flat nose bridge.
Slanted eyes that point upward.
A short neck.
Small ears, hands and feet.
Weak muscle tone at birth.
Small pinky finger that points inward towards the thumb.
One crease in the palm of their hand (palmar crease).
Shorter-than-average height.
As your child grows, additional symptoms can arise because of the way that their body developed in the uterus, including:

Ear infections or hearing loss.
Vision problems or eye diseases.
Dental problems.
Being more prone to infections or illnesses.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Congenital heart disease.
Your child’s healthcare provider will regularly check for these and other conditions that may cause additional symptoms throughout your child’s life.

Cognitive symptoms of Down syndrome
Your child with Down syndrome may have cognitive development challenges as a result of their extra chromosome. This can cause intellectual or developmental disabilities. Your child’s ability to meet developmental milestones, or things that your child can do at a certain age, may differ from other children, including how they:

Walk and move (gross and fine motor skills).
Speak (language development skills).
Learn (cognitive skills).
Play (social and emotional skills).
As a result, it may take your child longer to do the following things:

Toilet training.
Speaking their first words.
Taking their first steps.
Eating food independently.
Behavioral symptoms of Down syndrome
Your child diagnosed with Down syndrome may exhibit behavioral symptoms. This can be the result of your child not being able to communicate their needs to you or their caregivers effectively. Behavioral symptoms of Down syndrome could include:

Stubbornness and tantrums.
Difficulty paying attention.
Obsessive or compulsive behaviors.
What causes Down syndrome?
An extra chromosome causes Down syndrome. Each human cell typically contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which totals 46. Down syndrome occurs because of changes in the way cells in chromosome 21 divide. Every person with Down syndrome has an extra chromosome 21 in some or all of their cells.

There are three types of Down syndrome with different causes, including:

Trisomy 21.
Translocation.
Mosaicism.
What is trisomy 21?
Trisomy 21 is the most common type of Down syndrome. The term “trisomy” means having an extra copy of a chromosome. Trisomy 21 occurs when a developing fetus has three copies of chromosome 21 in every cell instead of the typical two copies. This type makes up 95% of all cases of Down syndrome.

What is translocation Down syndrome?
Translocation is a type of Down syndrome where there’s a partial or full amount of chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome. Unlike trisomy 21, translocation occurs when chromosome 21 isn’t separate, but it relocates to another numbered chromosome. This type of Down syndrome accounts for less than 4% of all cases.

What is mosaic Down syndrome?
Mosaic Down syndrome is the rarest type of Down syndrome and accounts for less than 1% of all cases. Mosaicism occurs when only some cells contain the usual 46 chromosomes and some cells contain 47. The extra chromosome in some cells is chromosome 21.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is Down syndrome diagnosed before birth?
A healthcare provider can suspect Down syndrome during pregnancy with prenatal screening tests. They can also diagnose this condition during pregnancy with diagnostic tests.

Prenatal screening tests
These tests assess your risk of having a child with Down syndrome rather than giving you a confirmation of a diagnosis. Screening tests could be a blood test of the birthing parent’s blood to look for indicators of Down syndrome. Another screening test is an ultrasound. During this imaging test, your provider will look for signs of Down syndrome, like extra fluid behind your baby’s neck. It’s possible that a screening test could be normal and not show signs of Down syndrome when the condition is present.

Diagnostic tests during pregnancy
Diagnostic tests during pregnancy can confirm a Down syndrome diagnosis. They usually take place after a positive screening test. Diagnostic testing offers more risk for the birthing parent and the developing fetus. Tests could include:

Amniocentesis.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS).
These tests can detect chromosomal changes that lead to a Down syndrome diagnosis.

How is Down syndrome diagnosed after birth?
After your baby is born, providers look for the physical signs of Down syndrome during a physical exam. To confirm the diagnosis, your baby’s provider may perform a blood test called a karyotype test. In this test, your baby’s provider will remove a small blood sample to study under a microscope. They’ll look for an extra 21st chromosome to diagnose the condition.

What if I find out that the fetus has Down syndrome?
If you find out the fetus you’re carrying has Down syndrome, your providers will direct you to resources to help you after the birth of your baby. You may want to participate in counseling or join a support group. Counselors and support groups help you prepare for raising a child with Down syndrome.

In support groups, you can talk with other parents about their experiences raising a child with Down syndrome. It’s a great way to share practical advice on managing the condition, its frustrations and joys. These groups offer a sense of belonging and give you support, so you know you’re not alone.

There’s no cure for Down syndrome, but treatment is available to help your child reach their full potential. Treatment focuses on helping your child thrive physically and mentally. Treatment options could include:

Physical or occupational therapy.
Speech therapy.
Participating in special education programs in school.
Treating any underlying medical conditions.
Wearing glasses for vision problems or assisted hearing devices for hearing loss.
Who is on my child’s care team?
If your child has Down syndrome, they’ll likely see a variety of specialists to make sure they’re healthy. Their care team may include:

Primary care providers to monitor growth, development and medical concerns and provide vaccinations.
Medical specialists, depending on the needs of the person (for example, cardiologist, endocrinologist, geneticist and hearing and eye specialists).
Speech therapists to help them communicate.
Physical therapists to help strengthen their muscles and improve motor skills.
Occupational therapists to help refine their motor skills and make daily tasks easier.
Behavioral therapists to help manage emotional challenges that can come with Down syndrome.
What other medical conditions are associated with Down syndrome?
People with Down syndrome may have other medical conditions that are either present at birth or develop over time. A healthcare provider can help you and your child manage these conditions. Common conditions of Down syndrome can include:

Heart problems.
Thyroid abnormalities.
Gastrointestinal problems like constipation, gastroesophageal reflux and celiac disease.
Autism, challenges with social skills, communication and repetitive behaviors.
Alzheimer’s disease.
Are people who have Down syndrome at greater risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease?
People with Down syndrome are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease occurs in about 30% of people with Down syndrome in their 50s and about 50% of those in their 60s.

Studies show the extra full or partial chromosome contributes to this increased risk of Alzheimer’s. Genes on chromosome 21 produce amyloid precursor protein, which plays an important role in the brain changes seen in Alzheimer’s patients.

Prevention
How can I prevent Down syndrome?
You can’t prevent Down syndrome since it’s a genetic condition. To learn more about your risk of having a child with a genetic condition, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have a child diagnosed with Down syndrome?
Children born with Down syndrome lead happy and healthy lives with supportive care. Treatment and therapies can help them reach developmental milestones, gain an education with their peers, build relationships and have successful careers.

Groups and resources are available for parents, family members and caregivers to help you best care for your child and support them.

Is there a cure for Down syndrome?
No. Down syndrome is a lifelong condition, and there isn’t a cure. Symptoms of the condition are manageable, and treatment is available for any associated conditions that may arise.

What is the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome?
The life expectancy for a person diagnosed with Down syndrome is 60 or older. They may need support and care throughout their entire life.

Living With
What resources are available for people living with Down syndrome and their families?
There are resources available to people with Down syndrome and their families. Many families join Down syndrome support groups to share their experiences and ways to help their children live a healthy, full life.

People with Down syndrome will likely need assistance throughout their lives. In addition to ongoing therapies, this could include help with education, employment and living independently. A variety of organizations offer resources to help educate and empower people living with Down syndrome and their families.

The National Down Syndrome Society and the National Association for Down Syndrome are two of the most common resources people use for more information and support.

What questions should I ask my doctor?
How can I prepare for the birth of my child if you suspect Down syndrome?
How can I support my child?
Can you recommend any resources for families?
Who should be on my child’s care team?
Additional Common Questions
Can people diagnosed with Down syndrome have children?
People diagnosed with Down syndrome may have children of their own. An estimated 50% of women or people assigned female at birth (AFAB) can have children. It’s normal for men or people assigned male at birth (AMAB) to have a low fertility rate if they have Down syndrome. If a birthing parent has Down syndrome, the risk of passing the genetic condition onto their future children is 35% to 50%.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

It may feel overwhelming to learn that your child has Down syndrome. As you process the news, know that you’re not alone and that your child’s extra chromosome is part of what makes them unique. You can find support through your child’s medical care team or by joining groups for families and caregivers to learn more about the condition and how to help your child grow.
Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to do math. Much like dyslexia disrupts areas of the brain related to reading, dyscalculia affects brain areas that handle math- and number-related skills and understanding. Symptoms of this condition usually appear in childhood, but adults may have dyscalculia without knowing it.
What is dyscalculia?
Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to understand number-based information and math. People who have dyscalculia struggle with numbers and math because their brains don’t process math-related concepts like the brains of people without this disorder. However, their struggles don’t mean they’re less intelligent or less capable than people who don’t have dyscalculia.

The symptoms of this disorder usually appear in childhood, especially when children learn how to do basic math. However, many adults have dyscalculia and don’t know it. People who have dyscalculia often face mental health issues when they have to do math, such as anxiety, depression and other difficult feelings.

There’s also a form of dyscalculia that appears later in life. This form, acquired dyscalculia, can happen at any age. This usually happens for other reasons like a medical condition (see more about this under the Causes and Symptoms section below).

What is the difference between dyslexia and dyscalculia?
Dyslexia and dyscalculia are both learning disorders, but they have key differences. In the most general terms, these two break down as follows:

Dyscalculia: This learning disorder affects a person’s ability to do math.
Dyslexia: This learning disorder affects a person’s ability to read.
While they’re different, the two conditions fall under the same diagnosis, “Specific learning disorder,” in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It’s also possible for people to have both dyscalculia and dyslexia.

Who does dyscalculia affect?
Dyscalculia can happen to anyone, but it’s common for it first to draw attention when children are in their first few years of elementary school (between ages 6 and 9).

How common is dyscalculia?
Dyscalculia is uncommon but widespread. Experts estimate it affects between 3% and 7% of people worldwide.

How does dyscalculia affect my brain?
People who have dyscalculia are neurodivergent. Neurodiversity is a term that describes how no two people have the same brain, and everyone’s brain forms and develops in a completely unique way. For people with dyscalculia, that means their brain works differently from the brain of someone who doesn’t have disorders or conditions that affect how their brain works.

Solving a math problem like “2+2=?” might seem simple, but it takes several different skills — and the areas of the brain that manage them — working together to do it. Some of those include:

Visual processing: Your eyes see the entirety of the math problem and send the components back to your brain for processing.
Short-term memory: You use your short-term memory to hold onto the specifics of the math problem as you work on it. For example, the number amounts, the symbols and the order in which they appear.
Language: You use this part of your brain to translate the symbols in the math problem into what those symbols mean. That’s how you know what the plus sign, equal sign and question mark mean in this context.
Long-term memory: You access this kind of memory to remember the process of how to solve a math problem. In this case, your brain identifies that this is an addition problem based on the plus sign and the equals sign.
Understanding of quantities and amounts: Your brain translates the symbol “2” into the understanding that it represents a specific amount or quantity. Children usually learn this principle by giving them examples like fruits or animals.
Calculation: This process unites all of the above, helping you solve that 2+2=4.
For a neurotypical person, the above processes all work as expected. Depending on how severe their case is, people with dyscalculia may struggle with certain parts of the process.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of dyscalculia?
The symptoms of dyscalculia depend on which parts of the process a person struggles with most. It can also depend on the person’s age and the situations they encounter most often.

Young children (up to the pre-K and kindergarten levels)
For very young children, the most common symptoms include trouble with:

Counting upward.
Connecting a number to that many of an object (for example, connecting the number 4 to that many marbles in front of them).
Recognizing numbers and math symbols.
Organizing numbers, such as largest to smallest or first to last.
Recognizing and using number lines.
Learning using money (such as coins or bills).
School-age children (primary/grade/elementary school)
The symptoms of dyscalculia often draw attention when children start school around age 6. For these children, the symptoms include trouble with:

Counting on fingers with small numbers (especially at an age where that seems unnecessary).
Identifying small quantities of items just by looking (this looks like needing to count each one by one).
Doing simple calculations from memory.
Memorizing multiplication tables.
Recognizing the same math problem when the order of the numbers or symbols changes (struggling to understand that 1+7=8 is the same as 8=7+1).
Understanding word problems or more advanced symbols (such as > meaning “greater than” or < meaning “less than”).
Organizing numbers by scale (10s, 100s, 1,000s) or decimal place (0.1, 0.01, 0.001).
Teenagers (secondary school- or high school-age) and adults
The symptoms in teenagers and adults often look like trouble with the following:

Counting backward.
Solving word problems.
Breaking down problems into multiple steps to solve them.
Measuring items.
Measuring quantities (such as for cooking/baking recipes).
Using money (coins and bills) to pay for items, exchanging bills for coins (and vice versa) and making change.
Understanding and converting fractions.
Emotional symptoms
In addition to symptoms that directly relate to someone’s ability to do math, people with dyscalculia may show emotional symptoms when faced with situations where math is necessary. Those emotional symptoms often include:

Anxiety (including test anxiety) or even panic.
Agitation, anger or aggression (such as temper tantrums in younger children).
Fear (including a fear or even phobia of going to school).
Physical symptoms of any of the above (nausea and vomiting, sweating, stomachache, etc.)
What causes dyscalculia?
In most cases, especially in children, experts don’t know why dyscalculia happens. There’s evidence that learning disorders — including dyscalculia — may run in families. However, more research is necessary to confirm this.

Experts do know that people with dyscalculia are more likely to have certain differences in some areas of their brain. These differences seem to indicate less development and fewer connections between brain cells in those areas. The affected areas are ones your brain uses when doing anything that involves numbers and calculations. However, experts don’t know why these differences happen and how they influence this disorder’s symptoms.

Related conditions
Dyscalculia often happens alongside other conditions. While these aren’t causes, they can be a clue to help healthcare providers recognize and diagnose dyscalculia. Conditions that often happen alongside dyscalculia include:

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Dyslexia, dysgraphia or non-verbal learning disorders.
Sensory processing disorders.
Autism spectrum disorder.
People with dyscalculia also have a higher risk of mental health disorders. Experts don’t know if these are more likely to happen because a person has dyscalculia, but these are still important factors that healthcare providers will consider when making a diagnosis and recommending treatment.

Anxiety disorder or panic disorder.
Behavior disorders (such as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder).
Bipolar disorder.
Depression.
Acquired dyscalculia
There are some reasons why a person would develop dyscalculia (or even acalculia, a complete inability to do math) later in life. This form, known as acquired dyscalculia, isn’t a learning disorder. Instead, it usually involves brain damage that disrupts areas related to math skills. Lesions, which are areas of brain damage, can happen for many reasons (see the Brain Lesions article to understand more about how this damage can happen).

Is it contagious?
Dyscalculia isn’t contagious, and you can’t catch it from or spread it to others.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is dyscalculia diagnosed?
Education professionals (usually teachers) and parents are most likely to be the first to notice the symptoms of dyscalculia. If a teacher notices it, they’ll be able to offer resources and guidance on next steps. Parents who notice dyscalculia can also talk to their child’s pediatrician to learn more about the process of diagnosing and treating dyscalculia.

There are two main criteria that the DSM-5 lists for math-related symptoms of specific learning disorder (with more about those criteria immediately below). At least one of these two criteria must exist for at least six months, even with trained, expert help to try and overcome it.

Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts or calculation.
Difficulties with mathematical reasoning.
What tests will be done to diagnose dyscalculia?
There are no lab, imaging or diagnostic tests that can confirm dyscalculia. Instead, the focus will be on testing a child’s specific math-related skills and ruling out other possible causes, such as vision or hearing problems, other brain- or mental health-related conditions, etc. Different tests can help with this. A healthcare provider is the best person to explain what kind of skills tests they recommend.

Management and Treatment
How is dyscalculia treated, and is there a cure?
Dyscalculia is treatable in children because their brains haven’t yet finished developing, making it possible for them to learn skills and develop abilities they need to adapt to this condition. Treatment usually takes the form of one-on-one learning programs.

The programs are symptom-specific and focus on what a child struggles with most. Treatment should also start as soon as possible. The sooner the treatment starts, the better the chances for children to adapt to this condition and limit the impacts.

Unfortunately, dyscalculia isn’t considered treatable in adults unless it’s acquired dyscalculia. That’s because their brains are fully developed, meaning treatments like learning programs are less likely to help them. For adults, the focus is on helping them compensate for dyscalculia using technology or other methods.

For acquired dyscalculia, there are possible treatments. The available treatments depend on many factors, especially the underlying cause of the dyscalculia. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the treatment options and which they recommend for your case.

Treatment for related conditions
In addition to learning programs for dyscalculia, children with this condition may need additional treatment for other conditions they have. The treatments for those conditions depend mostly on the condition themselves. They can include medication, psychotherapy and more. A healthcare provider is the best person to tell you more about the possible treatments, including what they recommend for the specific needs in question.

Prevention
How can I prevent dyscalculia or reduce my risk of developing it?
Dyscalculia happens unpredictably. That means it isn’t preventable, and there’s no way to reduce the risk of developing it.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have dyscalculia?
Depending on the specific symptoms, dyscalculia can make it harder to do even simple math-related tasks like paying bills, following recipes for cooking and baking, and more. With early treatment, children can often adapt to this condition and limit its impact on their lives. Adults who have it are more likely to struggle with the effects if they don’t receive treatment earlier in life. It’s also common for people with this disorder to feel embarrassed about this condition, and many experience anxiety, shame and depression because of it.

How long dyscalculia lasts
Dyscalculia is a lifelong condition. There’s no cure, but early treatment can help reduce the effects later in life.

The only exception to this is acquired dyscalculia, which may be a temporary condition. Whether or not it’s temporary depends on factors like why it happened and how severe it is. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you if acquired dyscalculia could be temporary and how long it may last.

What’s the outlook for this condition?
Dyscalculia isn’t a dangerous condition. However, people who have it are more likely to struggle with mental health conditions that happen alongside it. Conditions like depression and anxiety can have greater effects — including a risk of self-harm or suicide — so treating these when necessary is essential.

Living With
How do I take care of myself or manage the symptoms?
Dyscalculia isn’t a condition that you can self-diagnose or treat. In children, it’s important that they see a healthcare provider to diagnose and treat this condition as soon as possible. Waiting makes it less likely that treatment programs can help.

For adults who have dyscalculia, it isn’t possible to treat dyscalculia directly. For them, the focus is on compensating for the disorder. Technology and other tools, such as smartphone apps, can help with this. A healthcare provider can recommend specific apps or tools that can help. For those with acquired dyscalculia, a healthcare provider can also recommend possible treatments or ways to help with this condition.

Additional Common Questions
Does dyscalculia affect a person’s intelligence?
No, dyscalculia doesn’t affect intelligence directly. While some people with dyscalculia might also have intellectual disabilities, having dyscalculia doesn’t automatically make a person less intelligent. In fact, it’s common for people with dyscalculia to have an above-average score on IQ tests. People with dyscalculia are also often gifted in other areas, especially creative skills (especially the arts), problem-solving and more.

Is dyscalculia a form of autism?
No, dyscalculia and autism spectrum disorder are two different conditions. They both fall under the same category, neurodevelopmental (brain development) disorders, in the DSM-5 but are still very different.

Is dyscalculia related to ADHD?
Yes, dyslexia and ADHD have strong connections. ADHD is one of the more common conditions that happens alongside dyscalculia. However, most people who have one don’t have the other.

What can I do to help my child if I suspect they have dyscalculia?
Some things you can do include:

Seek out resources. Education professionals and healthcare providers may be able to provide guidance and direction on more resources that can help. Take advantage of their expertise to help your child.
Find what works and use it. There are many strategies and approaches to pick from that might help a child with dyscalculia. Some children benefit from using games, music or other approaches. Once you find something that works, use it. That will help your child learn in a way that works for them.
Be patient. Children with dyscalculia have a recognized condition that disrupts their ability to do math like children without this condition. This isn’t something they can help, but they can learn to overcome it. They’re more likely to succeed at learning to overcome it if they feel they have someone backing them along the way.
Be supportive and encouraging. It’s important to offer support and encouragement to children who have this issue. Without that support, children are prone to having low self-esteem issues, and many struggle with anxiety or depression related to this condition. However, children who have encouragement and support are more likely to succeed and learn how to work through their condition, keeping it from limiting them in the future.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that disrupts a person’s ability to understand numbers and math-related concepts. Children usually show symptoms between the ages of 6 and 9 (or even sooner). It’s also common that people who have dyscalculia will also have other conditions, including learning and mental health disorders.

With treatment and specialized learning programs, many children can develop skills and abilities that limit how much this disorder impacts their lives. For adults who learn they have this condition, treatment isn’t possible. However, there are tools and ways to compensate for this condition and keep it from disrupting their life and routine.

Dyslexia is a learning disability that disrupts how your brain processes written language. People with dyslexia have trouble with reading and related skills. It’s very treatable, and it doesn’t have to stand in the way of success.

What is dyslexia?
Dyslexia is a learning disability that makes reading and language-related tasks harder. It happens because of disruptions in how your brain processes writing so you can understand it. Most people learn they have dyslexia during childhood, and it’s typically a lifelong issue. This form of dyslexia is also known as “developmental dyslexia.”

Dyslexia falls under the umbrella of “specific learning disorder.” That disorder has three main subtypes:

Reading (dyslexia).
Writing (dysgraphia).
Math (dyscalculia).
How dyslexia affects language understanding
Reading starts with spoken language. In early childhood, speaking starts with making simple sounds. As you learn more sounds, you also learn how to use sounds to form words, phrases and sentences. Learning to read involves connecting sounds to different written symbols (letters).

This is where dyslexia enters the picture. It interferes with how your brain uses spoken language to “decode” writing. Your brain has trouble processing what you read, especially breaking words into sounds or relating letters to sounds when reading.

That slowdown in processing can affect everything that follows. That includes:

Slowed reading because you have trouble processing and understanding words.
Difficulties with writing and spelling.
Problems with how you store words and their meanings in your memory.
Trouble forming sentences to communicate more complex ideas.
How common is dyslexia?
Dyslexia is uncommon overall but widespread enough to be well-known. Experts estimate it affects about 7% of people worldwide. It affects people equally regardless of sex and race.

However, many people have symptoms that aren’t severe enough for diagnosis. Including people with symptoms but without a diagnosis, dyslexia may affect up to 20% of people worldwide.

Symptoms and Causes
What causes dyslexia?
The exact cause of dyslexia isn’t clear. However, several clues hint at how and why most cases happen.

Genetics. Dyslexia is highly genetic and runs in families. A child with one parent with dyslexia has a 30% to 50% chance of inheriting it. Genetic conditions like Down syndrome can also make dyslexia more likely to happen.
Differences in brain development and function. If you have dyslexia, you’re neurodivergent. That means your brain formed or works differently than expected. Research shows people with dyslexia have differences in brain structure, function and chemistry.
Disruptions in brain development and function. Infections, toxic exposures and other events can disrupt fetal development and increase the odds of later development of dyslexia.
Risk factors
Several risk factors can contribute to whether someone develops dyslexia. They include (but aren’t limited to):

Toxic exposures. Air and water pollution can increase your risk of developing dyslexia. This is especially true with heavy metals (like lead or manganese), nicotine and certain chemicals used as flame retardants.
Lack of access to reading material. The risk of developing dyslexia is higher for children who grow up in households where reading isn’t encouraged or where reading material is less available.
Learning environment limitations. Children with less learning support in school or similar environments are more likely to develop dyslexia.
What are the signs and symptoms of dyslexia?
As a child gets older, dyslexia can often look like:

Difficulty spelling simple words.
Trouble learning the names of letters.
Problems telling apart letters with similar shapes, such as “d” and “b” or “p” and “q.”
Trouble rhyming.
Reluctance to read aloud in class.
Trouble sounding out new words.
Trouble associating sounds with letters or parts of words.
Trouble learning how sounds go together.
Mixing up the position of sounds in a word.
Having one of the above doesn’t mean a person has dyslexia, but if they’re having trouble learning the basic skills for reading, then dyslexia screening and testing is a good way to see if they need specialized help.

Dyslexia also has levels of severity:

Mild: Difficulties are there, but you can compensate or work around them with the right accommodations or support.
Moderate: Difficulties are significant enough that you need specialized instructions and help. You may also need specific interventions or accommodations.
Severe: Difficulties are so pronounced that they continue to be a problem even with specialized interventions, accommodations and other forms of treatment.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is dyslexia diagnosed?
Although dyslexia is due to differences in your brain, no blood tests or lab screenings can detect it. Instead, careful evaluation and testing of common signs identify someone with this reading problem.

Testing for dyslexia should look at:

Decoding (reading unfamiliar words by sounding them out).
Oral language skills.
Reading fluency and reading comprehension.
Spelling.
Vocabulary.
Word recognition.
When should I have my child tested for dyslexia?
Typically, early testing is best for learning disabilities. Your child can begin learning new reading strategies sooner with an early diagnosis. Many children show reading problems before third grade, but the reading demands increase with age, and it’s important to diagnose any learning disorder as early as possible.

Your child’s school may recommend an evaluation for learning disabilities with a certified educational psychologist. Ask the school administration for help finding one available to you.

Management and Treatment
What treatment options exist for dyslexia?
Currently, no medications treat dyslexia. Instead, educational interventions can teach effective new ways to learn and read.

Children with dyslexia may work with a trained specialist to learn new reading skills. Sometimes, slowing down a lesson gives a child with dyslexia more time to cover topics. Work with your child’s school to ensure your child gets the education they deserve.

How can I help my child with dyslexia?
The most important thing you can do is to spend time reading aloud with your child. That time spent together can help them as they work on their reading skills.

It’s also important to remember that dyslexia isn’t something that your child has control over. Be patient and supportive. The encouragement and backing you provide can be the boost your child needs as they learn to manage their dyslexia. It can also help them feel less anxious or afraid about reading-related activities.

You can also be an advocate for your child. You and your child’s school can develop an Individualized Education Plan (called an IEP). This document sets personalized expectations and lesson plans for your child at school.

Is dyslexia in adults treatable?
Yes, adults can benefit from treatment for dyslexia. There are programs and tools available that can help you with dyslexia-related reading difficulties no matter your age.

Prevention
How can I prevent dyslexia?
Dyslexia isn’t preventable, but it’s often manageable with different strategies for learning and reading. You should:

Talk with a healthcare provider if you notice any early signs of dyslexia.
Work with your child’s school to develop an individualized education plan.
Support your child’s mental health, too, and consider mental health care if your child experiences anxiety or other issues related to their dyslexia.
Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for dyslexia?
Dyslexia often draws attention when children begin learning to read, but it isn’t always detected early. Without early diagnosis, many children struggle with reading problems throughout school and into adulthood.

When dyslexia remains undiagnosed, children struggle to succeed in school. Identifying dyslexia by second grade gives children more time to find different ways to learn and read.

Misconceptions about dyslexia have led some to believe that people with dyslexia aren’t smart. Although untrue, this assumption can have negative effects on children.

A child with dyslexia may suffer self-esteem issues or believe they aren’t intelligent. They also have a higher risk of developing mental health conditions like anxiety or depression. Positive support from parents and teachers can help a child overcome these obstacles.

Living With
What does living with dyslexia mean?
A common misconception is that dyslexia is a disease. Another misconception is that a person with dyslexia is less intelligent. Both of these ideas are false. In fact, research shows no link between intelligence and dyslexia. Many people with dyslexia go on to achieve highly in their fields of choice.

Having dyslexia means reading is hard for you, not that you’re incapable or lazy. Finding techniques to help manage dyslexia is critical to successful learning and self-esteem. Understand that having dyslexia doesn’t reflect poor intelligence.

Can you still be successful if you have dyslexia?
Yes. While dyslexia presents challenges for many who have it, there’s no shortage of high-achievers with dyslexia. Some examples of famous or very successful people with dyslexia include:

Jennifer Anniston (actor, producer).
Richard Branson (entrepreneur, businessperson and philanthropist).
Cher (singer).
Anderson Cooper (journalist).
Tom Cruise (actor).
Amanda Gorman (poet).
Selma Hayek (actor, director).
Tom Holland (actor).
Earvin “Magic” Johnson (athlete).
Keanu Reeves (actor, philanthropist, publisher).
Octavia Spencer (actor, author)
Steven Spielberg (director).
Tim Tebow (athlete).
Henry Winkler (actor).
Additional Common Questions
Is dyslexia a form of autism?
No, dyslexia and autism are separate conditions. Autism spectrum disorder and specific learning disorder (including dyslexia and the other two subtypes) all fall under neurodevelopmental disorders. But they aren’t the same thing. You can have both at once, but having them at the same time doesn’t mean one causes the other.

Similarly, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are also separate conditions. Like autism, ADHD is in the same class as specific learning disorder, and you can also have both ADHD and dyslexia at the same time. However, they’re also independent of each other, meaning having both doesn’t mean one caused the other.

Is dyslexia always a learning disability?
No, dyslexia isn’t always a learning disability. While developmental dyslexia (the learning disability form) is the most common type, another type is possible but much less common.

Acquired dyslexia is a form that can develop later in life. It’s almost always due to another medical event or condition. Damage to your brain can disrupt processes like reading. It’s most common with damage from a stroke, head injury or other illness that can injure your brain.

Is dyslexia a visual problem that causes letters to appear flipped or rotated?
Sometimes, but not always. Dyslexia is a condition that can affect your perception of letters and writing. However, not everyone experiences the exact same symptoms of dyslexia.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

Having dyslexia can be frustrating or embarrassing at any age. For children, it can be a major source of fear or anxiety, especially if they don’t know why they struggle to do something that others don’t have trouble with. If you or your child has dyslexia, it’s important to remember that it’s a widespread condition. It’s also not a sign that you’re less intelligent, unmotivated or lazy. It’s a difference in how your brain works. It creates challenges for you but doesn’t have to stand between you and your goals.

If your child’s teacher suspects your child has dyslexia, you can get help. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider, teacher or their school administrators and specialists to learn more about how you can help your child manage and even overcome their dyslexia.
Bipolar disorder is a chronic mood disorder that causes intense shifts in mood, energy levels and behavior. Manic and hypomanic episodes are the main sign of the condition, and most people with bipolar disorder also have depressive episodes. The condition is manageable with medications, talk therapy, lifestyle changes and other treatments.
What is bipolar disorder?
Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a lifelong mood disorder and mental health condition that causes intense shifts in mood, energy levels, thinking patterns and behavior. These shifts can last for hours, days, weeks or months and interrupt your ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.

There are a few types of bipolar disorder, which involve experiencing significant fluctuations in mood referred to as hypomanic/manic and depressive episodes. However, people with bipolar disorder aren’t always in a hypomanic/manic or depressive state. They also experience periods of normal mood, known as euthymia.

Manic episodes
A key feature of bipolar I disorder is manic episodes. To meet the criteria for bipolar I disorder, you must have had at least one manic episode in your life for at least a week with or without ever experiencing a depressive episode.

Mania is a condition in which you have a period of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, as well as extreme changes in emotions, thoughts, energy, talkativeness and activity level. This highly energized level of physical and mental activity and behavior is a change from your usual self and is noticeable by others.

People who are in manic states may indulge in activities that cause them physical, social or financial harm, such as suddenly spending or gambling extreme amounts of money or driving recklessly. They also occasionally develop psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, which can cause difficulties in distinguishing bipolar disorder from other disorders such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

People with certain types of bipolar such as bipolar II disorder experience hypomania, which is a less severe form of mania. It doesn’t last as long as manic episodes and it doesn’t interfere with daily functioning as much.

Depressive episodes
During a depressive episode, you experience a low or depressed mood and/or loss of interest in most activities, as well as many other symptoms of depression, such as:

Tiredness.
Changes in appetite.
Feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.
Why is bipolar disorder no longer called manic-depressive illness?
In the last few decades, the medical world, especially the field of psychiatry, has intentionally made a shift from using “manic-depressive illness” or “manic depression” to describe bipolar disorder. There are several reasons for this shift, including:

Healthcare providers used to use “manic depression” to describe a wide range of mental health conditions. As mental health condition classification systems, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), have become more sophisticated, the new term “bipolar disorder” allows for more clarity in diagnosis.
There’s a lot of stigma and negativity associated with the terms “manic” and “mania,” especially due to the use of “maniac.” Similarly, people use the term “depression” casually to describe periods of sadness that don’t qualify as clinical depression. Using “bipolar disorder” takes the focus away from these two words. “Bipolar disorder” is more of a clinical, medical term and less emotionally loaded than “manic depression.”
The term “manic depression” excludes the cyclothymic or hypomanic (bipolar II disorder) versions of the condition.
What are the types of bipolar disorder?
There are four types of bipolar disorder, including:

Bipolar I disorder: People with bipolar I disorder have experienced one or more episodes of mania. Most people with bipolar I will have episodes of both mania and depression, but an episode of depression isn’t necessary for a diagnosis. The depressive episodes usually last at least two weeks. To be diagnosed with bipolar I, your manic episodes must last at least seven days or be so severe that you need hospitalization. People with bipolar I can also experience mixed states (episodes of both manic and depressive symptoms).
Bipolar II disorder: People with bipolar II experience depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. But they never experience a full manic episode that’s characteristic of bipolar I disorder. While hypomania is less impairing than mania, bipolar II disorder is often more debilitating than bipolar I disorder due to chronic depression being more common in bipolar II.
Cyclothymic disorder (cyclothymia): People with cyclothymic disorder have a chronically unstable mood state. They experience hypomania and mild depression for at least two years. People with cyclothymia may have brief periods of normal mood (euthymia), but these periods last fewer than eight weeks.
Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders: If a person doesn’t meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I, II or cyclothymia but has still experienced periods of clinically significant abnormal mood elevation, it’s considered other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder.
What’s the difference between borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder?
While borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder have similar symptoms and are often confused for each other, they’re distinct conditions.

BPD involves a longstanding pattern of abrupt, moment-to-moment swings in moods, behavior and self-image that are often triggered by conflicts in interactions with other people. Nonsuicidal self-injury is also common in BPD but not in bipolar disorder.

Bipolar disorder is different from BPD because it involves distinct, longer-lasting episodes of mania/hypomania and/or depression. Several things can trigger manic or depressive episodes, such as sleep changes, stress, medications and substance use.

Who does bipolar disorder affect?
Bipolar disorder can affect anyone. The average age of onset is 25 years, but, more rarely, it can start as early as early childhood or as late as in your 40s or 50s.

Although bipolar disorder affects people assigned female at birth (AFAB) and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) in equal numbers, the condition tends to affect them differently.

People AFAB with bipolar disorder may switch moods more quickly. When people with bipolar disorder experience four or more manic or depressive episodes in a year, this is called “rapid cycling.” Varying levels of sex hormones and thyroid hormones, together with the tendency for people AFAB to be prescribed antidepressants, may contribute to the more rapid cycling in this population.

People AFAB with bipolar disorder may also experience more periods of depression than people AMAB.

How common is bipolar disorder?
Bipolar disorder affects approximately 5.7 million adult Americans or about 2.6% of the U.S. population.
What are the signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder?
The defining sign of bipolar I disorder is a manic episode that lasts at least one week, while people with bipolar II disorder or cyclothymia experience hypomanic episodes.

But many people with bipolar disorder experience both hypomanic/manic and depressive episodes. These changing mood states don’t always follow a set pattern, and depression doesn’t always follow manic phases. A person may also experience the same mood state several times — with periods of euthymia in between — before experiencing the opposite mood.

Mood changes in bipolar disorder can happen over a period of weeks, months and sometimes even years.

An important aspect of the mood changes is that they’re a departure from your regular self and that the mood change is sustained for a long time. It may be many days or weeks in the case of mania and many weeks or months in the case of depression.

The severity of the depressive and manic phases can differ from person to person and in the same person at different times.

Signs and symptoms of manic episodes
Some people with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania or hypomania many times throughout their life; others may experience them only rarely.

Signs and symptoms of a manic episode include:

Excessive happiness, hopefulness and excitement.
Sudden and severe changes in mood, such as going from being joyful to being angry and hostile.
Restlessness.
Rapid speech and racing thoughts.
Increased energy and less need for sleep.
Increased impulsivity and poor judgment, such as suddenly quitting your job.
Making grand and unattainable plans.
Reckless and risk-taking behavior, such as drug and alcohol misuse and having unsafe or unprotected sex.
Feeling like you’re unusually important, talented or powerful.
Psychosis — experiencing hallucinations and delusions (in the most severe manic episodes).
Most of the time, people experiencing a manic episode are unaware of the negative consequences of their actions. With bipolar disorder, suicide is an ever-present danger — some people become suicidal in manic episodes, not just depressive episodes.

If a person is having an intense manic episode, especially if they’re experiencing hallucinations and delusions, they may need to be hospitalized to protect themselves and others from possible harm.

Signs and symptoms of hypomania
Some people with bipolar disorder have milder manic-like symptoms. This is called hypomania. With hypomania, you may feel very good and find that you can get a lot done. People with hypomania can often function well in social situations or at work.

You may not feel like anything is wrong during a hypomanic episode. But your family and friends may notice your mood swings and activity level changes and think that they’re unusual for you. After hypomania, you might experience severe depression.

Signs and symptoms of depressive episodes
The symptoms of depressive episodes in bipolar disorder are the same as those of major depression. They include:

Overwhelming sadness.
Low energy and fatigue.
Lack of motivation.
Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness.
Loss of enjoyment of things that were once pleasurable for you.
Difficulty concentrating and making decisions.
Uncontrollable crying.
Irritability.
Increased need for sleep.
Insomnia or excessive sleep.
A change in appetite, causing weight loss or gain.
Thoughts of death or suicide (suicidal ideation).
If you’re experiencing suicidal ideation (thoughts of suicide), it’s important to seek immediate care. Call 911 or the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. Someone will be available to talk with you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Signs and symptoms of a mixed episode
The symptoms of a mixed episode include both manic and depressive symptoms together. During a mixed episode, you have the negative feelings and thoughts that come with depression but also feel agitated, restless and high energy.

People who experience mixed episodes often describe it as the worst part of bipolar disorder.

What causes bipolar disorder?
Scientists don’t yet know the exact cause of bipolar disorder.

But they do believe there’s a strong genetic (inherited) component. Bipolar disorder is considered one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions — more than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close biological relative with the condition. However, just because you have a biological relative with bipolar disorder, doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll also develop it.

Other factors that scientists think contribute to the development of bipolar disorder include:

Changes in your brain: Researchers have identified subtle differences in the average size or activation of some brain structures in people with bipolar disorder. However, brain scans can’t diagnose the condition.
Environmental factors like trauma and stress: A stressful event, such as the death of a loved one, a serious illness, divorce or financial problems can trigger a manic or depressive episode. Because of this, stress and trauma may also play a role in the development of bipolar disorder.
Scientists are currently performing research to determine the relationship that these factors have in bipolar disorder, how they may help prevent its onset and what role they may play in its treatment.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is bipolar disorder diagnosed?
To diagnose bipolar disorder, your healthcare provider may use many tools, including:

A physical exam.
A thorough medical history, which will include asking about your symptoms, lifetime history, experiences and family history.
Medical tests, such as blood tests, to rule out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as hyperthyroidism.
A mental health evaluation. Your healthcare provider may perform the evaluation, or they may refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.
To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, you must have experienced at least one episode of mania or hypomania. Mental health providers use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to diagnose the type of bipolar disorder a person may be experiencing.

To determine what type of bipolar disorder you may have, your mental health provider assesses the pattern of symptoms and how much they affect your life during the most severe episodes.

People with bipolar disorder are more likely to also have the following mental health conditions:

Anxiety.
Attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Substance use disorders/dual diagnosis.
Because of this, as well as the fact that memory is often impaired during mania so people can’t remember experiencing it, it can be difficult for healthcare providers to properly diagnose people with bipolar disorder.

People with bipolar disorder who are experiencing a severe manic episode with hallucinations may be incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder can also be misdiagnosed as borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Because of this, it’s important to be honest and thorough when explaining all of your symptoms and experiences when talking with your healthcare provider. It can also be helpful to include a loved one who may be able to provide additional details about your mental health history in your discussions with your provider.

Management and Treatment
How is bipolar disorder treated?
Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. An effective treatment plan usually includes a combination of the following therapies:

Psychotherapy (talk therapy).
Medications.
Self-management strategies, like education and identifying the early symptoms of an episode or possible triggers of episodes.
Helpful lifestyle habits, such as exercise, yoga and meditation. These can support, but not replace, treatment.
Other therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in cases that are poorly responsive to medication or where rapid control of symptoms is necessary to prevent harm.
Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, so treatment is a lifelong commitment. It can sometimes take several months to years before you and your healthcare provider find a comprehensive treatment plan that works best for you. Although this can be discouraging, it’s important to continue treatment.

Episodes of mania and depression typically come back over time. Between episodes, many people with bipolar disorder don’t have mood changes, but some people may have lingering symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment can help manage these symptoms.

If you have other mental health conditions in addition to bipolar disorder, such as anxiety or ADHD, it can be more difficult to treat the conditions. For example, the antidepressants healthcare providers prescribe to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the stimulants they prescribe to treat ADHD may worsen symptoms of bipolar disorder and may even trigger a manic episode.

Again, even though it may be difficult to treat these conditions, it’s not impossible. Be sure to stay committed to finding a treatment plan that works for you.

What types of therapy are used to treat bipolar disorder?
Psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy,” can be an effective part of the treatment plan for people with bipolar disorder.

Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help you identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts and behaviors. Working with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, can provide support, education and guidance to you and your family.

Different types of therapy for bipolar disorder include:

Psychoeducation: Psychoeducation is the way mental health professionals teach people about their mental health conditions. As bipolar disorder is a complex condition, learning about the condition and how it can affect your life can help you and your loved ones manage and cope with it better.
Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT): This therapy is designed to help you improve your moods by understanding and working with your biological and social rhythms. IPSRT is an effective therapy for people with mood disorders, including bipolar disorder. It emphasizes techniques to improve medication adherence (taking your medication regularly), manage stressful life events and reduce disruptions in social rhythms (day-to-day differences in habitual behaviors). IPSRT teaches you skills that let you protect yourself against the development of future manic or depressive episodes.
Family-focused therapy: This therapy is for adults and children with bipolar disorder and their caregivers. During this treatment, your loved ones will join you in therapy sessions of psychoeducation regarding bipolar disorder, communication improvement training and problem-solving skills training.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This is a structured, goal-oriented type of therapy. Your therapist or psychologist helps you take a close look at your thoughts and emotions. You’ll come to understand how your thoughts affect your actions. Through CBT, you can unlearn negative thoughts and behaviors and learn to adopt healthier thinking patterns and habits.
What medications are used to treat bipolar disorder?
Certain medications can help manage symptoms of bipolar disorder. You may need to try several different medications, with guidance from your healthcare provider, before finding what works best.

Medications healthcare providers generally prescribe to treat bipolar disorder include:

Mood stabilizers.
Second-generation (“atypical”) neuroleptics (also called antipsychotics).
Antidepressants.
If you’re taking medication for bipolar disorder, you should:

Talk with your healthcare provider to understand the risks, side effects and benefits of the medication.
Tell your healthcare provider about any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications or supplements you’re already taking.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you’re experiencing concerning side effects. They may need to change your dose or try a different medication.
Remember that medication for bipolar disorder must be taken consistently, as prescribed.
Mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder
People with bipolar disorder typically need mood-stabilizing medication to manage manic or hypomanic episodes.

Types of mood stabilizers and their brand names include:

Lithium (Eskalith®, Lithobid®, Lithonate®).
Valproic acid (Depakene®).
Divalproex sodium (Depakote®).
Carbamazepine (Tegretol®, Equetro®).
Lamotrigine (Lamictal®).
Lithium is one of the most widely prescribed and studied medications for treating bipolar disorder. Lithium is a natural salt and will reduce symptoms of mania within two weeks of starting therapy, but it may take weeks to months before the manic symptoms are fully managed. Because of this, healthcare providers often prescribe other drugs like antipsychotic drugs or antidepressant drugs to help manage symptoms.

Thyroid gland and kidney problems can sometimes develop when taking lithium, so your healthcare provider will monitor the function of your thyroid and kidneys, as well as monitor the levels of lithium in your blood, as levels can easily become too high.

Anything that lowers the level of sodium in your body, such as switching to a low-sodium diet, heavy sweating, fever, vomiting or diarrhea may cause a toxic buildup of lithium in your body. Be aware of these conditions and alert your doctor if you’re on lithium and experience them.

The following are signs of lithium toxicity (lithium overdose). Call your healthcare provider immediately or go to the nearest emergency room if you experience:

Blurred vision or double vision.
Irregular pulse.
Extremely fast or slow heartbeat.
Difficulty breathing.
Confusion and dizziness.
Severe trembling or convulsions.
Passing large amounts of pee.
Uncontrolled eye movements.
Unusual bruising or bleeding.
Neuroleptic medications for bipolar disorder
Healthcare providers often prescribe second-generation or atypical neuroleptics (antipsychotics) in combination with a mood stabilizer for people with bipolar disorder. These medications help with both manic and depressive episodes.

Only four of these drugs are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to help treat bipolar depression, including:

Cariprazine (Vraylar®).
Lurasidone (Latuda®).
Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (Symbyax®).
Quetiapine (Seroquel®).
However, other medications, such as olanzapine (Zyprexa®), risperidone (Risperdal®) and aripiprazole (Abilify®), are commonly prescribed as well.

Antidepressants for bipolar disorder
Healthcare providers sometimes prescribe antidepressant medication to treat depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, combining the antidepressant with a mood stabilizer to prevent triggering a manic episode.

Antidepressants are never used as the only medication to treat bipolar disorder because only taking an antidepressant drug can trigger a manic episode.

What are the side effects of bipolar disorder medications?
Side effects of bipolar disorder medications are common and vary by medication. It’s important to talk with your healthcare provider about what you can expect when taking certain medications. It’s also important to tell them if you’re experiencing side effects.

Never stop taking your medication unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. Abruptly stopping medication can cause severe side effects and trigger severe episodes.

The most common side effects of bipolar disorder medications include:

Weight gain.
Metabolic dysregulation, including abnormal lipid levels (dyslipidemia), high blood pressure (hypertension) and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia).
Drowsiness.
Akathisia — feelings of restlessness and agitation with a compelling need to move, rock or pace.
What other medical treatments are used for bipolar disorder?
Other treatment options your healthcare provider may consider for treating bipolar disorder include:

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): This is a procedure in which a brief application of an electric current to your brain, through your scalp, induces a seizure. It’s most often used to treat people with severe depression. ECT is very safe and highly effective for medication-resistant depression or acute life-threatening mania. It’s the best treatment for mania in people who are pregnant. ECT is uses general anesthesia, so you’ll be asleep during the procedure and won’t feel any pain.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): This therapy involves a short electromagnetic coil that passes an electric current into your brain. Healthcare providers sometimes use it to treat medication-resistant depression. It’s an alternative to ECT. TMS isn’t painful and doesn’t require general anesthesia.
Thyroid medications: These medications can sometimes act as mood stabilizers. Studies have shown positive results in reducing symptoms in people AFAB with hard-to-treat, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.
Ketamine treatment: Ketamine, an anesthetic, given at low doses through an IV, has been proven to provide short-term antidepressant and antisuicidal effects for people with bipolar disorder.
Hospitalization: This is considered an emergency option in bipolar disorder care. It becomes necessary when someone is experiencing a severe depressive or manic episode and they’re an immediate threat to themselves or others.
What lifestyle changes can help with bipolar disorder?
Your healthcare team will likely recommend making lifestyle changes to stop patterns of behavior that worsen the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Some of these lifestyle changes include:

Quit drinking alcohol and/or using recreational drugs and tobacco: It’s essential to quit drinking and using drugs, including tobacco, since they can interfere with medications you may take. They can also worsen bipolar disorder and trigger a mood episode.
Keep a daily diary or mood chart: Keeping track of your daily thoughts, feelings and behaviors can help you be aware of how well your treatment is working and/or help you identify potential triggers of manic or depressive episodes.
Maintain a healthy sleep schedule: Bipolar disorder can greatly affect your sleep patterns, and changes in your frequency of sleep can even trigger an episode. Prioritize a routine sleeping schedule, including going to sleep and getting up at the same times every day.
Exercise: Exercise has been proven to improve mood and mental health in general, so it may help manage your symptoms related to bipolar disorder. Since weight gain is a common side effect of bipolar disorder medications, exercise may also help with weight management.
Meditation: Meditation has been shown to be effective in improving the depression that’s part of bipolar disorder.
Manage stress and maintain healthy relationships: Stress and anxiety can worsen mood symptoms in many people with bipolar disorder. It’s important to manage your stress in a healthy way and to try to eliminate stressors when you can. A big part of this is maintaining healthy relationships with friends and family who support you, and letting go of toxic relationships with people who add stress to your life.
Prevention
Can bipolar disorder be prevented?
Unfortunately, there’s no known way to prevent bipolar disorder because scientists don’t know its exact cause.

But it’s important to know the signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder and to seek early intervention.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook (prognosis) of bipolar disorder?
The prognosis for bipolar disorder is often poor unless it’s properly treated. Many people with bipolar disorder who receive appropriate treatment can live fulfilling and productive lives.

Bipolar disorder results in approximately a nine-year reduction in expected life span, and as many as 1 in 5 people with bipolar disorder commit suicide. An estimated 60% of all people with bipolar disorder have drug or alcohol dependence.

This is why it’s essential to seek medical care and stay committed to treatment for bipolar disorder.

Regular and continued use of medication can help reduce episodes of mania and depression. By knowing how to recognize the symptoms and triggers of these episodes, there’s a better chance for effective treatment and finding coping methods that may prevent long periods of illness, extended hospital stays and suicide.

Living With
When should I see my healthcare provider about bipolar disorder?
If you’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, you’ll need to see your healthcare team regularly throughout your life to make sure your treatment is working well for you. This team may include your:

Primary healthcare provider.
Psychiatrist.
Psychologist or therapist.
Neurologist.
When should I go to the emergency room (ER) for bipolar disorder?
If you’re experiencing any of these situations, it’s essential to call 911 or get to the nearest emergency room:

Thoughts of death or suicide.
Thoughts or plans of hurting yourself or others.
Experiencing hallucinations and delusions.
Symptoms of lithium toxicity (overdose), such as severe nausea and vomiting, severe hand tremors, confusion and vision changes.
A note from Cleveland Clinic
Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. But long-term, ongoing treatment, such as medication and talk therapy, can help manage your symptoms and enable you to live a healthy, purposeful life. It’s important to see your healthcare team regularly to monitor your treatment plan and symptoms. Know that your healthcare providers and loved ones are there to support you.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition in which you have frequent unwanted thoughts that cause you to perform repetitive behaviors. Treatment for OCD usually involves psychotherapy and medication. The sooner OCD is diagnosed and treated, the better the outlook.

What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition in which you have frequent unwanted thoughts and sensations (obsessions) that cause you to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors can significantly interfere with social interactions and performing daily tasks.

OCD is usually a life-long (chronic) condition, but symptoms can come and go over time.

Everyone experiences obsessions and compulsions at some point. For example, it’s common to occasionally double-check the stove or the locks. People also often use the phrases “obsessing” and “obsessed” very casually in everyday conversations. But OCD is more extreme. It can take up hours of a person’s day. It gets in the way of normal life and activities. Obsessions in OCD are unwanted, and people with OCD don’t enjoy performing compulsive behaviors.

What is the difference between OCD and OCPD?
Even though they sound similar, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are different conditions.

OCPD is a personality disorder that causes an extensive preoccupation with perfectionism, organization and control.

People with OCD are usually aware that their obsessions and compulsions are problematic and accept that they need professional help to treat the condition. People with OCPD usually don’t think there’s anything wrong with their behavior and beliefs.

Who does OCD affect?
OCD can affect anyone. The average age of onset is 19 years. About 50% of people with OCD begin to have symptoms in childhood and adolescence.

It’s rare for someone to develop OCD after the age of 40.

How common is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?
Obsessive-compulsive disorder is relatively common. It affects 1.6% to 2.3% of the general U.S. population.
What are the symptoms of OCD?
The main symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions that interfere with normal activities. For example, symptoms may often prevent you from getting to work on time. Or you may have trouble getting ready for bed in a reasonable amount of time.

You may know that these symptoms are problematic, but you can’t stop them. Symptoms of OCD may come and go, ease over time or worsen over time.

If you or your child have symptoms of OCD that interfere with your/their daily life, you should talk to a healthcare provider.

Obsessions in OCD
In OCD, obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts or mental images that cause intense anxiety. People with OCD can’t control these thoughts. Most people with OCD realize that these thoughts are illogical or irrational.

Common examples include:

Fear of coming into contact with perceived contaminated substances, such as germs or dirt.
Fear of causing harm to yourself or someone else because you’re not careful enough or you’re going to act on a violent impulse.
Unwanted thoughts or mental images related to sex.
Fear of making a mistake.
Excessive concern with morality (“right or wrong”).
Feelings of doubt or disgust.
Excessive concern with your sexual orientation or gender identity.
Need for order, neatness, symmetry or perfection.
Need for constant reassurance.
Compulsions in OCD
In OCD, compulsions are repetitive actions that you feel like you have to do to ease or get rid of the obsessions.

People with OCD don’t want to perform these compulsive behaviors and don’t get pleasure from them. But they feel like they have to perform them or their anxiety will get worse. Compulsions only help temporarily, though. The obsessions soon come back, triggering a return to the compulsions.

Compulsions are time-consuming and get in the way of important activities that you value. They don’t have to match the content of your obsessions.

Examples include:

Arranging things in a very specific way, such as items on your dresser.
Bathing, cleaning or washing your hands over and over.
Collecting or hoarding items that have no personal or financial value.
Repeatedly checking things, such as locks, switches and doors.
Constantly checking that you haven’t caused someone harm.
Constantly seeking reassurance.
Rituals related to numbers, such as counting, doing a task a specific amount of times, or excessively preferring or avoiding certain numbers.
Saying certain words or prayers while doing unrelated tasks.
Compulsions can also include avoiding situations that trigger obsessions. One example is refusing to shake hands or touch objects that other people touch a lot, like doorknobs.

What causes OCD?
Researchers don’t know what exactly causes OCD. But they think several factors contribute to its development, including:

Genetics: Studies show that people who have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with OCD are at a higher risk for developing the condition. The risk increases if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen.
Brain changes: Imaging studies have shown differences in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures of the brain in people who have OCD. OCD is also associated with other neurological conditions that affect similar areas of your brain, including Parkinson’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome and epilepsy.
PANDAS syndrome: PANDAS is short for “pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections.” It describes a group of conditions that can affect children who have had strep infections, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. OCD is one of these conditions.
Childhood trauma: Some studies show an association between childhood trauma, such as abuse or neglect, and the development of OCD.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is OCD diagnosed?
There’s no test for OCD. A healthcare provider makes the diagnosis after asking you about your symptoms and medical and mental health history. Providers use criteria explained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) to diagnose OCD.

The criteria include:

Having obsessions, compulsions or both.
The obsessions or compulsions take up a lot of time (more than an hour per day).
The obsessions or compulsions cause distress or affect your participation in social activities, work responsibilities or other life events.
The symptoms aren’t caused by substances, alcohol, medications or another medical condition.
The symptoms aren’t explained by a different mental health condition, such as generalized anxiety disorder, eating disorder or body image disorder.
Management and Treatment
How is OCD treated?
The most common treatment plan for OCD involves psychotherapy (talk therapy) and medication.

If this treatment doesn’t help your OCD symptoms and your symptoms are severe, your provider may recommend transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

Psychotherapy for OCD
Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help you identify and change unhealthy emotions, thoughts and behaviors. You work with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist.

There are several types of psychotherapy. The most common and effective forms for treating OCD include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): During CBT, a therapist will help you examine and understand your thoughts and emotions. Over several sessions, CBT can help alter harmful thoughts and stop negative habits, perhaps replacing them with healthier ways to cope.
Exposure and response prevention (ERP): ERP is a type of CBT. During ERP, a therapist exposes you to your feared situations or images and has you resist the urge to perform a compulsion. For example, your therapist may ask you to touch dirty objects but then stop you from washing your hands. By staying in a feared situation without anything negative happening, you learn that your anxious thoughts are just thoughts and not necessarily reality.
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): ACT helps you learn to accept obsessive thoughts as just thoughts, taking the power away from them. An ACT therapist will help you learn to live a meaningful life despite your OCD symptoms.
Mindfulness techniques such as meditation and relaxation can also help with symptoms.

Medication for OCD
Medications called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), selective SRIs (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants may help treat OCD.

Healthcare providers most often recommend SSRIs for OCD and prescribe them at much higher doses than they do for anxiety or depression. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SSRIs include:

Fluoxetine.
Fluvoxamine.
Paroxetine.
Sertraline.
It may take up to eight to 12 weeks for these medications to start working.

Prevention
Can I prevent OCD?
You can’t prevent OCD. But early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce its symptoms and its effects on your life.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis of OCD?
The prognosis (outlook) of OCD can vary. OCD is often a lifelong condition that can wax and wane.

People with OCD who receive appropriate treatment often experience increased quality of life and improved social, school and/or work functioning.

If you don’t receive treatment, the cycle of obsessions and compulsions is more difficult to break and treat, as structural changes in your brain take place. Because of this, it’s key to seek medical care as soon as possible if you or your child experience symptoms.

Living With
How do I take care of myself if I have OCD?
Aside from seeking medical treatment for OCD, practicing self-care can help manage your symptoms. Examples include:

Getting quality sleep.
Exercising regularly.
Eating a healthy diet.
Spending time with loved ones who support you and understand OCD.
Practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, massage and visualization.
Joining an in-person or online support group for people who have OCD.
When should I see my healthcare provider about OCD?
If you or your child have received an obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosis, you’ll likely need to see your healthcare provider and/or mental health professional regularly to make sure your treatment is working.

If you’re taking medication for OCD and notice any unpleasant side effects, talk to your healthcare provider.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

It’s important to remember that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition. As with all mental health conditions, seeking help as soon as symptoms appear can help decrease the disruptions to your life. Healthcare providers and mental health professionals can offer treatment plans that can help you manage your obsessions and compulsions.
Dysgraphia is a neurological condition and learning difference in which someone has difficulty with writing for their age level. This can range from issues with the physical act of writing to issues with translating thoughts into written words. Dysgraphia is manageable with interventions that can help you learn new writing strategies.

What is dysgraphia?
Dysgraphia is a neurological condition in which someone has difficulty turning their thoughts into written language for their age and ability to think, despite exposure to adequate instruction and education. Dysgraphia can present with many different symptoms at different ages. It’s considered a learning difference.

Writing is a complex process that involves many skills and brain functions, including:

Fine motor skills.
Spatial perception (ability to perceive the space around you).
Working memory (ability to hold and manipulate information in your mind).
Orthographic coding (ability to form, store and recall letters, numbers and symbols).
Language processing.
Conceptualization.
Organization.
Because of this, dysgraphia is somewhat of a catch-all term to diagnose issues with writing and can be difficult to diagnose.

Dysgraphia generally appears when children are first learning to write. This is called developmental dysgraphia. People can also develop dysgraphia suddenly after some type of head or brain trauma. This is called acquired dysgraphia.

Dysgraphia is considered a “specific learning disorder” — more specifically, a “specific learning disorder in written expression.”

Is dysgraphia a form of dyslexia?
Dyslexia and dysgraphia are two distinct neurological conditions, though they’re easy to confuse because they share symptoms and often occur together.

Dyslexia is a learning difference that makes it harder for people to learn to read. If you have dyslexia, you may read more slowly or have trouble recognizing words. Often, people with dyslexia read at a lower level than expected. People with dyslexia may struggle to break words into sounds or relate letters to sounds when reading.

Dysgraphia involves difficulty with the act of writing. Difficulties can range from issues with physically writing words to issues with organizing and expressing thoughts in written form.

Is dysgraphia a form of autism?
Dysgraphia isn’t a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Though dysgraphia commonly occurs in people with autism, you can have dysgraphia without having autism.

Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by:

Difficulties in social communication differences.
Deficits in social interactions.
Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities.
Sensory problems.
Who does dysgraphia affect?
Dysgraphia can affect children and adults. As with many neurodevelopmental conditions, dysgraphia is more common in children assigned male at birth (AMAB) than in children assigned female at birth (AFAB).

You’re more likely to have dysgraphia if other family members also have it, and dysgraphia is common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

How common is dysgraphia?
Dysgraphia is common. Researchers estimate that 5% to 20% of people have dysgraphia. The estimated range is large because dysgraphia often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the signs of dysgraphia?
People with dysgraphia may have several different difficulties when it comes to writing and may speak more easily and fluently than they write. They may have issues with:

Letter formation and/or legibility.
Letter size and spacing.
Spelling.
Fine motor coordination.
Rate or speed of writing.
Grammar.
Composition.
Specific ways dysgraphia can present include:

Difficulties writing in a straight line.
Difficulties with holding and controlling a writing tool.
Writing letters in reverse.
Having trouble recalling how letters are formed.
Having trouble knowing when to use lower or upper case letters.
Struggling to form written sentences with correct grammar and punctuation.
Omitting words from sentences.
Incorrectly ordering words in sentences.
Using verbs and pronouns incorrectly.
Having one of these signs doesn’t mean that a person has dysgraphia, but if your child is having trouble learning the basic skills for writing that are appropriate for their age, they should be tested to see if they need specific help.

What causes dysgraphia?
Scientists and neurologists aren’t sure what causes developmental dysgraphia. Writing is a complex task, and several areas of your brain are involved in the process. There seems to be a genetic link, as dysgraphia often runs in families.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is dysgraphia diagnosed?
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) includes dysgraphia under the “specific learning disorder” category, but doesn’t define it as a separate disorder and doesn’t have specific criteria for diagnosis. This can make dysgraphia difficult — but not impossible — to diagnose.

Similar to the assessment process for dyslexia, an assessment for dysgraphia involves careful consideration of your child’s:

Learning strengths and weaknesses.
Educational history.
The extent of their writing difficulties.
The type of writing difficulties they’re having.
What impact targeted teaching therapy (remediation) and support has had on their current academic achievement levels.
The diagnosis of dysgraphia is typically made in an educational setting by a team assessment, which can include the following specialists:

Occupational therapists.
Physical therapists.
Special education teachers.
Educational psychologists.
Speech therapists.
Neuropsychologists.
When should my child be tested for dysgraphia?
Typically, early testing is best for learning differences. Your child can learn new writing strategies sooner when dysgraphia is diagnosed early. Depending on how your child is affected by dysgraphia, they may show signs of the condition as early as 5 years old or as late as young adulthood.

As writing demands in school increase with age, it’s important to diagnose dysgraphia as early as possible. It’s also important to remember that it’s never too late to get a diagnosis and help.

Your child’s school may recommend an evaluation for learning disabilities with a certified educational psychologist. Ask the school administration for help finding one available to you.

What tests will be done to diagnose dysgraphia?
There’s no medical testing required or available for diagnosing dysgraphia. Instead, healthcare providers and education specialists carefully assess your child’s writing difficulties to make a diagnosis.

Healthcare providers may use the following assessments and tests in the diagnostic process:

Formalized handwriting assessments: These tests can help measure the speed and legibility of your child’s writing.
Beery Developmental Test of Visuomotor Integration (VMI): This test helps assess the extent to which your child can integrate their visual and motor skills, which is necessary for writing.
These tests don’t assess all the possible aspects of dysgraphia, so your child’s education team will likely rely on additional methods to diagnose dysgraphia. Depending on your child and their learning differences, more thorough academic testing may be done.

Management and Treatment
How is dysgraphia managed?
As dysgraphia has a broad range of signs and each person is affected differently by it, management for dysgraphia is very individualized.

Currently, no medications treat dysgraphia. Instead, educational interventions can teach effective, new ways to write.

In general, educational interventions can be categorized by the following levels:

Accommodation: Your child has access to the mainstream education curriculum with supportive or assistive resources without changing the educational content.
Modification: Your child’s school adapts your child’s goals and objectives, as well as provides services to reduce the effect of dysgraphia. For example, your child may be able to orally give test answers instead of writing them.
Remediation: Your child’s school provides specific interventions to decrease the severity of dysgraphia.
It’s important to advocate for your child and work with their school to ensure your child receives the education they deserve.

Prevention
Can I prevent dysgraphia?
Unfortunately, you can’t prevent dysgraphia. But you can manage it by finding different strategies to write.

Early diagnosis is essential — talk with your child’s healthcare provider if you notice any early signs of dysgraphia. If your child is diagnosed, work with their school to develop an individualized education plan (IEP).

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis (outlook) for dysgraphia?
When dysgraphia remains undiagnosed, children struggle to succeed in school.

Writing is an important academic skill that’s been associated with overall academic achievement.

Children who have difficulty with writing are often mislabeled as sloppy or lazy rather than being recognized as having a learning disorder.

Because of this, a child with dysgraphia may have self-esteem issues or believe they’re not intelligent. Positive support from loved ones and teachers can help a child overcome these obstacles.

Living With
What does living with dysgraphia mean?
Having dysgraphia means writing is difficult for you, not that you’re incapable or lazy. Finding techniques to help manage dysgraphia is critical to successful learning and self-esteem. Understand that having dysgraphia doesn’t reflect poor intelligence.

How can I help my child with dysgraphia?
Be an advocate for your child. You and your child’s school can develop an individualized education plan (IEP). This document sets personalized expectations and lesson plans for your child at school.

You can also help your child build writing skills at home. Try out pencil grips and other tools that may make writing easier. Look for apps or software that can help with handwriting and graphic organizers that can help with writing assignments.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

If you or your child’s teacher suspects your child has a learning difference like dysgraphia, you can get help. Dysgraphia is a manageable neurological condition. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider, teacher or the school’s administration to discover ways to help your child with their writing skills.
Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to understand number-based information and math. People who have dyscalculia struggle with numbers and math because their brains don’t process math-related concepts like the brains of people without this disorder. However, their struggles don’t mean they’re less intelligent or less capable than people who don’t have dyscalculia.

The symptoms of this disorder usually appear in childhood, especially when children learn how to do basic math. However, many adults have dyscalculia and don’t know it. People who have dyscalculia often face mental health issues when they have to do math, such as anxiety, depression and other difficult feelings.

There’s also a form of dyscalculia that appears later in life. This form, acquired dyscalculia, can happen at any age. This usually happens for other reasons like a medical condition (see more about this under the Causes and Symptoms section below).

What is the difference between dyslexia and dyscalculia?
Dyslexia and dyscalculia are both learning disorders, but they have key differences. In the most general terms, these two break down as follows:

Dyscalculia: This learning disorder affects a person’s ability to do math.
Dyslexia: This learning disorder affects a person’s ability to read.
While they’re different, the two conditions fall under the same diagnosis, “Specific learning disorder,” in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It’s also possible for people to have both dyscalculia and dyslexia.

Who does dyscalculia affect?
Dyscalculia can happen to anyone, but it’s common for it first to draw attention when children are in their first few years of elementary school (between ages 6 and 9).

How common is dyscalculia?
Dyscalculia is uncommon but widespread. Experts estimate it affects between 3% and 7% of people worldwide.

How does dyscalculia affect my brain?
People who have dyscalculia are neurodivergent. Neurodiversity is a term that describes how no two people have the same brain, and everyone’s brain forms and develops in a completely unique way. For people with dyscalculia, that means their brain works differently from the brain of someone who doesn’t have disorders or conditions that affect how their brain works.

Solving a math problem like “2+2=?” might seem simple, but it takes several different skills — and the areas of the brain that manage them — working together to do it. Some of those include:

Visual processing: Your eyes see the entirety of the math problem and send the components back to your brain for processing.
Short-term memory: You use your short-term memory to hold onto the specifics of the math problem as you work on it. For example, the number amounts, the symbols and the order in which they appear.
Language: You use this part of your brain to translate the symbols in the math problem into what those symbols mean. That’s how you know what the plus sign, equal sign and question mark mean in this context.
Long-term memory: You access this kind of memory to remember the process of how to solve a math problem. In this case, your brain identifies that this is an addition problem based on the plus sign and the equals sign.
Understanding of quantities and amounts: Your brain translates the symbol “2” into the understanding that it represents a specific amount or quantity. Children usually learn this principle by giving them examples like fruits or animals.
Calculation: This process unites all of the above, helping you solve that 2+2=4.
For a neurotypical person, the above processes all work as expected. Depending on how severe their case is, people with dyscalculia may struggle with certain parts of the process.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of dyscalculia?
The symptoms of dyscalculia depend on which parts of the process a person struggles with most. It can also depend on the person’s age and the situations they encounter most often.

Young children (up to the pre-K and kindergarten levels)
For very young children, the most common symptoms include trouble with:

Counting upward.
Connecting a number to that many of an object (for example, connecting the number 4 to that many marbles in front of them).
Recognizing numbers and math symbols.
Organizing numbers, such as largest to smallest or first to last.
Recognizing and using number lines.
Learning using money (such as coins or bills).
School-age children (primary/grade/elementary school)
The symptoms of dyscalculia often draw attention when children start school around age 6. For these children, the symptoms include trouble with:

Counting on fingers with small numbers (especially at an age where that seems unnecessary).
Identifying small quantities of items just by looking (this looks like needing to count each one by one).
Doing simple calculations from memory.
Memorizing multiplication tables.
Recognizing the same math problem when the order of the numbers or symbols changes (struggling to understand that 1+7=8 is the same as 8=7+1).
Understanding word problems or more advanced symbols (such as > meaning “greater than” or < meaning “less than”).
Organizing numbers by scale (10s, 100s, 1,000s) or decimal place (0.1, 0.01, 0.001).
Teenagers (secondary school- or high school-age) and adults
The symptoms in teenagers and adults often look like trouble with the following:

Counting backward.
Solving word problems.
Breaking down problems into multiple steps to solve them.
Measuring items.
Measuring quantities (such as for cooking/baking recipes).
Using money (coins and bills) to pay for items, exchanging bills for coins (and vice versa) and making change.
Understanding and converting fractions.
Emotional symptoms
In addition to symptoms that directly relate to someone’s ability to do math, people with dyscalculia may show emotional symptoms when faced with situations where math is necessary. Those emotional symptoms often include:

Anxiety (including test anxiety) or even panic.
Agitation, anger or aggression (such as temper tantrums in younger children).
Fear (including a fear or even phobia of going to school).
Physical symptoms of any of the above (nausea and vomiting, sweating, stomachache, etc.)
What causes dyscalculia?
In most cases, especially in children, experts don’t know why dyscalculia happens. There’s evidence that learning disorders — including dyscalculia — may run in families. However, more research is necessary to confirm this.

Experts do know that people with dyscalculia are more likely to have certain differences in some areas of their brain. These differences seem to indicate less development and fewer connections between brain cells in those areas. The affected areas are ones your brain uses when doing anything that involves numbers and calculations. However, experts don’t know why these differences happen and how they influence this disorder’s symptoms.

Related conditions
Dyscalculia often happens alongside other conditions. While these aren’t causes, they can be a clue to help healthcare providers recognize and diagnose dyscalculia. Conditions that often happen alongside dyscalculia include:

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Dyslexia, dysgraphia or non-verbal learning disorders.
Sensory processing disorders.
Autism spectrum disorder.
People with dyscalculia also have a higher risk of mental health disorders. Experts don’t know if these are more likely to happen because a person has dyscalculia, but these are still important factors that healthcare providers will consider when making a diagnosis and recommending treatment.

Anxiety disorder or panic disorder.
Behavior disorders (such as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder).
Bipolar disorder.
Depression.
Acquired dyscalculia
There are some reasons why a person would develop dyscalculia (or even acalculia, a complete inability to do math) later in life. This form, known as acquired dyscalculia, isn’t a learning disorder. Instead, it usually involves brain damage that disrupts areas related to math skills. Lesions, which are areas of brain damage, can happen for many reasons (see the Brain Lesions article to understand more about how this damage can happen).

Is it contagious?
Dyscalculia isn’t contagious, and you can’t catch it from or spread it to others.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is dyscalculia diagnosed?
Education professionals (usually teachers) and parents are most likely to be the first to notice the symptoms of dyscalculia. If a teacher notices it, they’ll be able to offer resources and guidance on next steps. Parents who notice dyscalculia can also talk to their child’s pediatrician to learn more about the process of diagnosing and treating dyscalculia.

There are two main criteria that the DSM-5 lists for math-related symptoms of specific learning disorder (with more about those criteria immediately below). At least one of these two criteria must exist for at least six months, even with trained, expert help to try and overcome it.

Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts or calculation.
Difficulties with mathematical reasoning.
What tests will be done to diagnose dyscalculia?
There are no lab, imaging or diagnostic tests that can confirm dyscalculia. Instead, the focus will be on testing a child’s specific math-related skills and ruling out other possible causes, such as vision or hearing problems, other brain- or mental health-related conditions, etc. Different tests can help with this. A healthcare provider is the best person to explain what kind of skills tests they recommend.

Management and Treatment
How is dyscalculia treated, and is there a cure?
Dyscalculia is treatable in children because their brains haven’t yet finished developing, making it possible for them to learn skills and develop abilities they need to adapt to this condition. Treatment usually takes the form of one-on-one learning programs.

The programs are symptom-specific and focus on what a child struggles with most. Treatment should also start as soon as possible. The sooner the treatment starts, the better the chances for children to adapt to this condition and limit the impacts.

Unfortunately, dyscalculia isn’t considered treatable in adults unless it’s acquired dyscalculia. That’s because their brains are fully developed, meaning treatments like learning programs are less likely to help them. For adults, the focus is on helping them compensate for dyscalculia using technology or other methods.

For acquired dyscalculia, there are possible treatments. The available treatments depend on many factors, especially the underlying cause of the dyscalculia. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the treatment options and which they recommend for your case.

Treatment for related conditions
In addition to learning programs for dyscalculia, children with this condition may need additional treatment for other conditions they have. The treatments for those conditions depend mostly on the condition themselves. They can include medication, psychotherapy and more. A healthcare provider is the best person to tell you more about the possible treatments, including what they recommend for the specific needs in question.

Prevention
How can I prevent dyscalculia or reduce my risk of developing it?
Dyscalculia happens unpredictably. That means it isn’t preventable, and there’s no way to reduce the risk of developing it.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if I have dyscalculia?
Depending on the specific symptoms, dyscalculia can make it harder to do even simple math-related tasks like paying bills, following recipes for cooking and baking, and more. With early treatment, children can often adapt to this condition and limit its impact on their lives. Adults who have it are more likely to struggle with the effects if they don’t receive treatment earlier in life. It’s also common for people with this disorder to feel embarrassed about this condition, and many experience anxiety, shame and depression because of it.

How long dyscalculia lasts
Dyscalculia is a lifelong condition. There’s no cure, but early treatment can help reduce the effects later in life.

The only exception to this is acquired dyscalculia, which may be a temporary condition. Whether or not it’s temporary depends on factors like why it happened and how severe it is. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you if acquired dyscalculia could be temporary and how long it may last.

What’s the outlook for this condition?
Dyscalculia isn’t a dangerous condition. However, people who have it are more likely to struggle with mental health conditions that happen alongside it. Conditions like depression and anxiety can have greater effects — including a risk of self-harm or suicide — so treating these when necessary is essential.

Living With
How do I take care of myself or manage the symptoms?
Dyscalculia isn’t a condition that you can self-diagnose or treat. In children, it’s important that they see a healthcare provider to diagnose and treat this condition as soon as possible. Waiting makes it less likely that treatment programs can help.

For adults who have dyscalculia, it isn’t possible to treat dyscalculia directly. For them, the focus is on compensating for the disorder. Technology and other tools, such as smartphone apps, can help with this. A healthcare provider can recommend specific apps or tools that can help. For those with acquired dyscalculia, a healthcare provider can also recommend possible treatments or ways to help with this condition.

Additional Common Questions
Does dyscalculia affect a person’s intelligence?
No, dyscalculia doesn’t affect intelligence directly. While some people with dyscalculia might also have intellectual disabilities, having dyscalculia doesn’t automatically make a person less intelligent. In fact, it’s common for people with dyscalculia to have an above-average score on IQ tests. People with dyscalculia are also often gifted in other areas, especially creative skills (especially the arts), problem-solving and more.

Is dyscalculia a form of autism?
No, dyscalculia and autism spectrum disorder are two different conditions. They both fall under the same category, neurodevelopmental (brain development) disorders, in the DSM-5 but are still very different.

Is dyscalculia related to ADHD?
Yes, dyslexia and ADHD have strong connections. ADHD is one of the more common conditions that happens alongside dyscalculia. However, most people who have one don’t have the other.

What can I do to help my child if I suspect they have dyscalculia?
Some things you can do include:

Seek out resources. Education professionals and healthcare providers may be able to provide guidance and direction on more resources that can help. Take advantage of their expertise to help your child.
Find what works and use it. There are many strategies and approaches to pick from that might help a child with dyscalculia. Some children benefit from using games, music or other approaches. Once you find something that works, use it. That will help your child learn in a way that works for them.
Be patient. Children with dyscalculia have a recognized condition that disrupts their ability to do math like children without this condition. This isn’t something they can help, but they can learn to overcome it. They’re more likely to succeed at learning to overcome it if they feel they have someone backing them along the way.
Be supportive and encouraging. It’s important to offer support and encouragement to children who have this issue. Without that support, children are prone to having low self-esteem issues, and many struggle with anxiety or depression related to this condition. However, children who have encouragement and support are more likely to succeed and learn how to work through their condition, keeping it from limiting them in the future.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that disrupts a person’s ability to understand numbers and math-related concepts. Children usually show symptoms between the ages of 6 and 9 (or even sooner). It’s also common that people who have dyscalculia will also have other conditions, including learning and mental health disorders.

With treatment and specialized learning programs, many children can develop skills and abilities that limit how much this disorder impacts their lives. For adults who learn they have this condition, treatment isn’t possible. However, there are tools and ways to compensate for this condition and keep it from disrupting their life and routine.
What is Prader-Willi syndrome?
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition that affects your child’s metabolism and causes changes to their body and behavior. They have severe low muscle tone and poor feeding during early infancy, followed by a tremendous appetite that develops between 2 and 6 years of age. This can lead to severe obesity if excessive eating isn’t managed.

PWS typically also causes a delay in childhood milestones and puberty. Although rare, life-threatening complications can occur and include respiratory illnesses, obesity-related cardiovascular problems, sleep apnea and diabetes.

Who does Prader-Willi syndrome affect?
Anyone can develop Prader-Willi syndrome because it’s a genetic condition that happens randomly when reproductive cells form. In rare cases, you can inherit the condition if it runs in your biological family history.

How common is Prader-Willi syndrome?
Throughout the world, PWS affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people.

What are the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome?
Prader-Willi syndrome affects each person differently. Symptoms that appear in infancy may include:

A weak cry.
Lethargy (tiredness).
Poor feeding ability.
Weak muscle tone (hypotonia).
Symptoms that affect your child’s body may be present at birth but become more apparent as they grow. These may include:

Almond-shaped eyes.
A long, narrow head.
A triangular mouth.
Short height.
Small hands and feet.
Underdeveloped genitals.
Additional symptoms that affect your child’s development and behavior include:

Temper tantrums, emotional outbursts or stubbornness.
Problems with cognitive development (intellectual disability).
Obsessive or compulsive behaviors like skin picking.
Sleep abnormalities.
Eating challenges like not feeling satisfied after eating or eating an unusually large amount of food (hyperphagia).
Hyperphagia may lead to class III obesity, which increases the likelihood of other complications, such as diabetes and heart disease.

What causes Prader-Willi syndrome?
Genes on chromosome 15 that lose function cause Prader-Willi syndrome. At conception, you inherit one copy of chromosome 15 from each of your biological parents. The paternal copy of chromosome 15 is the only one that activates or turns on. The maternal copy is turned off. Both copies are necessary for your genes to get the instructions your body needs to function. This process is called genomic imprinting.

There are different causes of this genetic change to chromosome 15:

Chromosomal deletion: Nearly 70% of all PWS cases occur when part of the paternal chromosome 15 is missing in each cell. Symptoms arise because the paternal copy of chromosome 15 is missing or not working properly and the maternal copy is turned off.
Maternal uniparental disomy: About 25% of PWS cases happen when a child inherits two maternal copies of chromosome 15 instead of one from each biological parent. This means that both copies of chromosome 15 don’t work because they’re inactive.
Translocation: Less than 1% of all cases occur when a piece of chromosome 15 relocates itself to another chromosome. This makes the genes that the chromosome produces work ineffectively since they’re not where they’re supposed to be.
Chromosome 15 is responsible for providing instructions for making small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). The job of snoRNAs is to regulate the function of other RNA molecules. RNA molecules create proteins that help cells complete many functions within your body. A change to chromosome 15 limits its ability to create snoRNAs or they don’t receive the instructions they need to complete their jobs correctly.

Diagnosis and Tests
How is Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosed?
A healthcare provider will diagnose Prader-Willi syndrome after a physical exam and genetic tests. A provider will look for physical signs of the condition during the exam and ask you questions about your child’s symptoms, including their eating habits and behavior. If your provider suspects PWS, they’ll run a genetic test, which is a blood test that detects abnormalities due to changes to your child’s DNA.

Management and Treatment
How is Prader-Willi syndrome treated?
Treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment could include:

Devices, such as special bottle nipples, to help infants get enough nutrition.
Helping your child eat properly, including a low-calorie diet and managing how much they eat.
Medications to increase amounts of certain hormones, such as growth hormone, and testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for boys or children assigned male at birth (AMAB) and estrogen for girls or children assigned female at birth (AFAB).
Supportive therapies such as physical therapy, speech-language therapy and special education to improve physical and cognitive function.
What are the complications associated with Prader-Willi syndrome?
Many people with Prader-Willi syndrome develop obesity from overeating. Complications from obesity may include:

Cardiac (heart) problems.
Diabetes (Type 2).
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Respiratory (lung) problems.
Sleep apnea (interrupted breathing during sleep).
Obesity is a complex but manageable condition. Your child’s healthcare provider can offer guidance on how you can help your child and prevent complications.

Prevention
How can I prevent Prader-Willi syndrome?
You can’t prevent Prader-Willi syndrome because it’s a genetic condition. Many cases are the result of a random genetic change that’s unpredictable and not the result of something the biological parents did before or during pregnancy. To learn more about your risks of having a child with a genetic condition, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing.

Outlook / Prognosis
What can I expect if my child has Prader-Willi syndrome?
With early and ongoing treatment, many individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome have a normal lifespan. Needing extra help in school is common. Each person with PWS needs lifelong support to achieve as much independence as possible. Your provider might recommend that you visit a nutritionist to help facilitate a meal plan and diet that can help your child manage their eating. Meeting with a mental health professional or joining a support group is a great resource for parents and families. It can help them find ways to adapt and learn how to help their child grow and meet their full potential.

Is there a cure for Prader-Willi syndrome?
There isn’t a cure for Prader-Willi syndrome. Research is ongoing to learn more about the condition.

Living With
When should I see a healthcare provider?
If you notice your child has signs of Prader-Willi syndrome, visit their healthcare provider. It’s especially important to see their provider if they miss developmental milestones during infancy. With an early diagnosis, your child’s provider can help you manage your child’s condition, help them meet developmental milestones and manage their diet to reduce complications from the condition.

What questions should I ask my doctor?
How can I help my child avoid obesity?
What will my child’s treatment involve?
What kinds of behavioral issues might my child have?
Are there support groups to help us learn about and cope with PWS?
Should others in my family have genetic testing?
A note from Cleveland Clinic

It may be overwhelming to learn that your child has a rare genetic condition without a cure. Your child’s care team will offer support and guidance so you can give your child the care they need as they grow and develop. Your child may need more time than others their age to reach their milestones. They’ll also need supportive care throughout their life to prevent complications. If you have questions about your child’s diagnosis or how to best care for your child, talk to your child’s provider.

Tourette syndrome is a disorder that causes uncontrollable movements and vocal sounds called tics. It often shows up in early childhood and improves in adulthood. Tics can be mild or severe. About 200,000 people in the U.S. have a severe form of Tourette syndrome. Medication and therapy can help reduce tics.

About one in 100 children have some form of tic disorder. Tourette syndrome is less common. It affects about one out of 160 children.

Is Tourette’s the only tic disorder?
Tourette syndrome is the most severe tic disorder, but there are other types. Your healthcare provider will use your symptoms to determine what kind of tic disorder you have.

Tic disorders include:

Provisional tic disorder: Motor or vocal tics (one or both) for less than one year.
Persistent (chronic) tic disorder: Motor or vocal tics (not both) for more than one year.
Tourette syndrome: Motor and vocal tics (both) for more than one year.
Signs and Symptoms
What are the symptoms of Tourette syndrome?
Tics are the main symptom of Tourette’s. They usually start between ages five and seven, peaking around age 12.

Tics are complex or simple:

Complex tics involve many movements and muscle groups. Jumping is a complex motor tic. Repeating certain words or phrases is a complex vocal tic.
Simple tics are quick, repeated movements that only involve a few muscle groups. Shoulder shrugging is a simple motor tic. Sniffing is a simple vocal tic.
Other examples of motor tics include:

Arm jerking.
Bending at the waist.
Eye blinking.
Head jerking or twisting.
Hopping.
Jaw movements.
Twisted or distorted facial expressions.
Examples of vocal tics include:

Barking.
Grunting.
Shouting.
Sniffing.
Throat clearing.
Are tics ever harmful?
Some tics are harmful, such as motor tics that cause someone to hit themselves in the face. A vocal tic called coprolalia leads to swearing or inappropriate language. This type of tic can make someone seem purposefully disruptive or offensive, even though it’s an uncontrollable impulse. Children with coprolalia might receive unwarranted punishment at school or at home.

Causes
What causes Tourette syndrome?
The exact cause of Tourette syndrome (TS) is unknown. The condition tends to run in families, so genes probably play a role. Problems with how your brain metabolizes (breaks down) neurotransmitters may also contribute to TS. Neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, are chemicals in the brain that regulate behavior and movement.

What are the risk factors for Tourette syndrome?
Risk factors for Tourette syndrome include:

Gender: Males are three to four times more likely than females to develop TS.
Family history: Parents may pass TS down to children through genes (inherited).
Prenatal health: Children born to mothers who smoked or had health complications during pregnancy may be at a higher risk for TS. Low birth weight may also increase the chances of TS.
Diagnosis and Tests
How is Tourette syndrome diagnosed?
For a healthcare provider to diagnose someone with a tic disorder, the tics must have started before the age of 18. To diagnose you with Tourette’s, you must have been experiencing motor and vocal tics (both) for more than a year.

There isn’t a blood test or imaging exam that can detect Tourette syndrome. Instead, your healthcare provider carefully reviews your medical history and symptoms. They may ask detailed questions about the tics, including:

How often do the tics happen?
At what age did the tics start?
What is the nature of the tics (simple or complex)?
Your healthcare provider may also do tests to rule out other conditions that could be causing tics.

Does Tourette’s ever occur with other health conditions?
Most people with Tourette’s have other health conditions. These are usually mental or behavioral health disorders, including:

Anxiety disorders.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Depression.
Learning disabilities.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).
Management and Treatment
What is the treatment for Tourette syndrome?
Mild tics that don’t affect everyday activities might not need treatment. However, severe tics can make it hard to function at work, school or in social situations. Some tics even lead to self-injury. In these cases, medication or behavioral therapy may help.

How can medication help Tourette syndrome?
Your healthcare provider may recommend neuroleptics for Tourette syndrome. Neuroleptics are drugs that limit the activity of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that can increase tics. Other medications can help manage conditions that occur with Tourette’s, such as ADHD or OCD.

How can behavioral therapy help Tourette syndrome?
The tics associated with Tourette’s are involuntary, so they aren’t something you can control. But new therapies help people manage tics and reduce their negative effects.

Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) helps people:

Respond to tics: Doing a new and different action when a tic occurs is a “competing response.” A voluntary action (shutting your eyes) limits the involuntary action (blinking).
Recognize tics: Sometimes people feel a sensation right before a tic occurs called a premonitory urge. By recognizing this urge, they may be able to mask or suppress the tic.
Reduce tics: Excitement or anxiety tend to make tics worse. Staying calm and avoiding stressful situations may reduce the frequency of tics.
Prevention
Is Tourette syndrome preventable?
Tourette syndrome isn’t preventable. But, early detection and treatment may prevent TS from worsening or lasting into adulthood.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the outlook for someone living with Tourette syndrome?
There’s no cure for Tourette syndrome. The condition usually improves in early adulthood. Tics may still occur, but most adults don’t need to continue medication or therapy. People with Tourette syndrome have a normal life expectancy.

Living With
What can I do to make living with Tourette syndrome easier?
Living with Tourette syndrome can be challenging, especially for children. It might be hard for them to focus on schoolwork and interact with others. A strong support system of friends, family members and teachers helps children manage Tourette’s.

Children with Tourette’s may also benefit from:

Being in classes with fewer students.
Getting personalized attention at school.
Having more time to complete assignments.
When should I contact my healthcare provider about Tourette syndrome?
Contact a healthcare provider right away if someone with Tourette syndrome:

Becomes violent.
Injures themselves.
Talks about suicide. You can call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. In an emergency, call 911.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

Tourette syndrome is a neurological condition. It causes someone to make involuntary movements or sounds called tics. The disorder starts in childhood and usually decreases in early adulthood. Medication and behavioral therapy are the most common treatments for Tourette syndrome. Neurologists or psychiatrists can care for Tourette’s.
the U.S. population.

Symptoms and Causes
What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
Symptoms of anxiety disorders vary depending on the type.

Psychological symptoms may include:

Feeling panic, fear, dread and uneasiness.
Feeling on edge or irritable.
Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts.
Difficulty concentrating.
Physical symptoms may include:

Restlessness.
Heart palpitations.
Shortness of breath.
Muscle tension.
Cold or sweaty hands.
Dry mouth.
Nausea.
Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet.
Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia).
It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional if you frequently experience these symptoms.

What causes anxiety disorders?
Like other types of mental health conditions, researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders. But they think a combination of factors plays a role:

Chemical imbalances: Several neurotransmitters and hormones play a role in anxiety, including norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Imbalances in these chemicals can contribute to an anxiety disorder.
Brain changes: A part of your brain called the amygdala plays an important role in managing fear and anxiety. Studies show that people with anxiety disorders show increased amygdala activity in response to anxiety cues.
Genetics: Anxiety disorders tend to run in biological families. This suggests that genetics may play a role. You may be at an increased risk of developing one if you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder.
Environmental factors: Severe or long-lasting stress can change the balance of neurotransmitters that control your mood. Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can contribute to an anxiety disorder. Experiencing a traumatic event can also trigger anxiety disorders.
Diagnosis and Tests
How are anxiety disorders diagnosed?
If you or your child are experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder, see a healthcare provider. They’ll start with a medical evaluation. They’ll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history, any medications you’re taking and if any of your family members have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

There aren’t any blood tests or imaging scans that can diagnose anxiety disorders. But your provider may run some of these tests to rule out physical conditions that may be causing your symptoms, like hyperthyroidism, for example. If there isn’t an underlying physical cause, your provider may refer you to a mental health professional.

A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, will do an interview or survey, asking questions about your symptoms, sleeping habits and other behaviors. They use criteria in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 to make diagnoses of anxiety disorders.

Typically, the provider bases a diagnosis on:

Your reported symptoms, including how intense they are and how long they last.
Discussion of how the symptoms interfere with your daily life.
The provider’s observation of your attitude and behavior.
Management and Treatment
How are anxiety disorders treated?
An anxiety disorder is like any other health condition that requires treatment. You can’t will it away. It’s not a matter of self-discipline or attitude. Researchers have made a lot of progress in the last few decades in treating mental health conditions. Your healthcare provider will tailor a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan may include a combination of medication and psychotherapy (talk therapy).

Medication for anxiety disorders
Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve the symptoms and help you function better. Medications for anxiety disorders often include:

Antidepressants: While they mainly treat depression, these medications can also help with anxiety disorders. They adjust how your brain uses certain chemicals to improve mood and reduce stress. Antidepressants may take some time to work, so try to be patient. SSRIs and SNRIs are the go-to types of antidepressants for anxiety. Tricyclic antidepressants are another option, but they cause more side effects.
Benzodiazepines: This class of medications may decrease your anxiety, panic and worry. They work quickly, but you can build up a tolerance to them. They also have addiction potential, so you have to take them cautiously. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine for the short term, then taper you off. Benzodiazepines that can help treat anxiety disorders include alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam and lorazepam.
Beta-blockers: These medications can help reduce some of the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders, like rapid heartbeat, shaking and trembling. They don’t treat the psychological aspects of anxiety disorders.
Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the right medication combination and dosage. Don’t change the dose or stop taking medications without talking to your provider first. They’ll monitor you to make sure the medicines are working without causing negative side effects.

Psychotherapy for anxiety disorders
“Psychotherapy,” also called talk therapy, is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help you identify and change unhealthy emotions, thoughts and behaviors. A mental health provider talks through strategies to help you better understand and manage an anxiety disorder. Approaches include:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This is the most common type of psychotherapy to help manage anxiety disorders. CBT for anxiety teaches you to recognize and identify thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings. You then work on changing the thoughts and your reactions to triggering situations.
Exposure therapy: This is a type of therapy in which a mental health provider creates a safe environment to expose you to your fears. Fears may be things, situations and/or activities. Exposure therapy helps show you that you’re capable of confronting your fears. You’ll learn to attach new, more realistic beliefs to the things you’re afraid of. You’ll become more comfortable with the experience of fear.
Prevention
Can I prevent developing an anxiety disorder?
Currently, there’s no known way to prevent anxiety disorders. But you can lessen many of the related issues with treatment. Seeking help as soon as symptoms appear can help decrease the disruption to your life.

Outlook / Prognosis
What is the prognosis for people with anxiety disorders?
Left untreated, anxiety disorders can lead to serious complications, including:

Difficulty with social situations and decreased quality of life.
Substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder.
Major depressive disorder.
Suicide (in cases of severe anxiety).
Constant anxiety also increases your risk of cardiac events, like a heart attack.

This is why it’s crucial to seek help if you have an anxiety disorder. Treatment is effective. The right treatment can help improve your quality of life, relationships and productivity. It can also support your overall well-being.

Living With
How can I take care of myself if I have an anxiety disorder?
Aside from seeking professional medical help and treatment, certain strategies can help you manage an anxiety disorder and make treatment more effective. They include:

Stress management: Chronic or intense stress worsens anxiety disorders. Explore stress management techniques, like meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and regular exercise. 
Support groups: Participating in a support group for people with anxiety — in-person or online — can provide opportunities to relate to others, share experiences and learn different coping strategies.
Education: Learning more about your condition and educating loved ones can help you and them better understand the condition and offer support.
Limiting or avoiding caffeine: Caffeine can make the physical symptoms of anxiety worse. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re concerned about your level of caffeine consumption.
When should I see my healthcare provider?
Your healthcare provider is your partner in your care. If you feel like treatment for an anxiety disorder isn’t working or have questions about your medication, contact your provider. Together, you can figure out how to best move forward.

A note from Cleveland Clinic
You don’t need to live with constant worry and fear. If you notice symptoms of an anxiety disorder, talk to a healthcare provider. It’s best to get diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Doing so can limit the problems that anxiety disorders can cause. Often, a combination of medications and counseling for anxiety can help you feel your best.

Autism increasingly requires a multidisciplinary approach that can effectively harmonize the realms of diagnosis and therapy, tailoring both to the individual. Assistive technologies (ATs) play an important role in this context and hold significant potential when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). (Objective) The objective of this study is to analyze the state of integration of AI with ATs in autism through a review. (Methods) A review was conducted on PubMed and Scopus, applying a standard checklist and a qualification process. The outcome reported 22 studies, including 7 reviews. (Key Content and Findings) The results reveal an early yet promising interest in integrating AI into autism assistive technologies. Exciting developments are currently underway at the intersection of AI and robotics, as well as in the creation of wearable automated devices like smart glasses. These innovations offer substantial potential for enhancing communication, interaction, and social engagement for individuals with autism. Presently, researchers are prioritizing innovation over establishing a solid presence within the healthcare domain, where issues such as regulation and acceptance demand increased attention. (Conclusions) As the field continues to evolve, it becomes increasingly clear that AI will play a pivotal role in bridging various domains, and integrated ATs with AI are positioned to act as crucial connectors.

Autism, scientifically known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a wide range of challenges in social communication, language, behavior, and social interaction [1,2,3,4,5]. The manifestations of autism vary widely, giving rise to the concept of the “spectrum”, which includes individuals with mild to severe symptoms. Signs of autism can emerge from early childhood but are often identified in preschool or school age, when they become more evident. Symptoms include difficulty with verbal and nonverbal communication, difficulty interacting with others, repetitive and restricted interests and activities, and increased or decreased sensory sensitivity. To diagnose autism, a multidisciplinary approach is used [6,7,8]. Specialists, such as psychologists, child psychiatrists, and pediatricians, conduct interviews and observations to evaluate the individual’s behavior, language, social skills, and cognitive abilities. Diagnosis is often completed through structured questionnaires, developmental assessments, and assessments of communication skills [1,2,3]. In addition to behavioral assessments and questionnaires, genetic analysis can be an integral part of the diagnosis of autism since there is a genetic component to its etiology [2,3,4,5]. Blood tests and genetic tests can identify genetic abnormalities associated with autism [4]. Also, imaging can have a strategic role, as in the case of functional magnetic resonance [9], which is also integrated with AI [10,11]. Therapy is crucial in autism, providing specialized support to address the cognitive, communication, and behavioral challenges associated with the disorder. Through targeted therapeutic interventions, individuals with autism can develop social, communication, and adaptation skills, improving their quality of life and promoting greater inclusion in society [12,13,14,15,16]. Therapy represents an essential foundation for promoting the progress and well-being of people with autism. Multidisciplinary approaches in autism involve different professionals, such as psychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and pediatricians, who collaborate to provide holistic treatment targeted to the specific needs of each individual with autism [12,14,15]. This synergy between experts contributes to a more complete, personalized, and effective intervention, addressing cognitive, communicative, and behavioral challenges in an integrated way and optimizing the progress and well-being of patients. Assistive technology (AT) tools provide personalized technological solutions for people with autism, helping them overcome communication barriers and adapt to their specific needs [16]. These tools amplify skills and improve independence, significantly contributing to the quality of life of people with autism.

1.2. Beyond Communication: The Versatility of Assistive Technology in Autism Care
Assistive technologies [17,18,19,20,21], ranging from robots [17] to sensors [18], particularly Augmentative and Alternative Communications (AAC) [19], play a fundamental role in improving the lives of people with autism by addressing the communication challenges that often accompany this disorder. For many people with autism, verbal communication can be a significant barrier. AAC [19] offers an alternative avenue, allowing these people to express themselves in ways that reflect their individual needs. This customization is critically important, as autism is an extremely heterogeneous disorder, and what works for one individual may not be as effective for another. One of the main benefits of AAC [19,20] is the reduction of frustration. The inability to communicate effectively can lead to high levels of anxiety and stress. AAC reduces this frustration by providing a means to express needs and desires, helping to improve mental health and interpersonal relationships. These technologies also have a significant impact on education. AAC can be used to support learning, helping students with autism develop language and cognitive skills [19]. Furthermore, they improve school inclusion, allowing students with autism to actively participate in educational activities. Another area in which AAC proves essential is improving social interactions. AAC facilitates communication and the establishment of meaningful relationships, which is often challenging for people with autism. These tools help people with autism participate more actively in conversations and social activities, improving the quality of their interactions. Independence is an important goal for many people with autism. AAC contributes to this goal by allowing people to communicate their needs and make autonomous decisions, promoting a greater level of autonomy in daily life. Overall, assistive technologies, such as AAC, are a valuable resource for people with autism. They enable them to overcome communication challenges, improve the quality of social interactions, support learning, and promote independence. These tools are fundamental in the field of autism, contributing significantly to the well-being and inclusion of these people in society.

1.3. AI’s Potential in Autism Assistive Technologies
Artificial intelligence (AI) could play a significant role in helping to personalize assistive technologies for individuals with autism [22,23]. From a future perspective, it could be capable of conducting a precise assessment of individual needs. AI, at least potentially, could analyze complex data, such as an individual’s behaviors and responses, to determine which tools and supports would be most suitable. This would mean that AI could contribute to designing solutions tailored to each individual, taking specific needs into account. Another potential of AI would be to adapt assistive technologies in real-time. This would mean that devices could automatically adjust settings based on user interactions and behaviors. For instance, if a person with autism were displaying signs of stress or frustration, AI could intervene to offer targeted support. Another important potential aspect of AI is machine learning. AI could learn from the user’s progress and challenges over time. This would mean that assistive technologies could continually improve their effectiveness, adapting to the evolving needs of individuals with autism. AI could also be capable of customizing the interfaces of assistive technologies to meet user preferences. This could make the tools more accessible and user-friendly, facilitating interaction and usage by the individual. Finally, AI could contribute to creating personalized learning and communication programs. These programs could take into account the individual’s skill level and specific progress, offering targeted support to help them develop their abilities. In summary, AI could play a key role in tailoring and optimizing assistive technologies for individuals with autism, contributing to improving their quality of life and fostering greater engagement and well-being.

1.4. Potential Emerging Questions
Key questions in personalizing assistive technologies with AI in ASD are emerging from the above:

How can AI precisely assess individual needs for individuals with autism?
In what ways can AI enable the real-time adaptation of assistive technologies?
How does machine learning enhance the adaptability of assistive technologies over time?
To what extent can AI customize interfaces for user preferences in assistive technologies?

What ethical considerations are crucial when implementing AI in assistive technologies for individuals with autism?
How can AI contribute to a more user-centered design approach in developing assistive technologies?
These questions suggest the need for a review.

1.5. Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study is to explore the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of AI into assistive technologies for individuals with autism. By overviewing the ways in which AI can personalize and adapt these technologies to meet the specific needs of individuals on the autism spectrum, this article aims to shed light on the opportunities for improved support, communication, and quality of life for this community. Additionally, it seeks to highlight the importance of ongoing research and innovation in this field to ensure that individuals with autism receive the most effective and personalized assistance possible.

4. Discussion
The discussion is structured into two parts, which are editorially translated into five paragraphs.

The initial part reported in Section 4.1, sets the stage, delving into the dissemination trends within this field. We examine these trends in contrast to the broader, overarching categories of ATs, which include AAC, both in a general context and, more specifically, within the realm of autism. The second part (Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.4 and Section 4.5) delves into: (a) a detailed discussion of the key findings that have emerged in the study results, paying careful attention to the distinctive characteristics of autism. (b) Analyze the limitations and bottlenecks that have come to light within the reviewed studies.

4.1. Numerical Trends in Assistive Technologies for Autism
It is valuable to delve into the analysis of scientific publication trends within this specific field. The key insights encapsulated in Box 1 have been utilized in research conducted on the PubMed platform. Scientific publications pertaining to AAC, as well as other assistive technologies, trace their origins back to the year 1946. In a broader context, as depicted in Figure 1, a cumulative total of 17,607 studies have been brought forth to the scientific community. Notably, a substantial 8500 of these have emerged within the last decade, with a further 3911 publications emerging since the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. A significant proportion of these studies, roughly 39%, have seen the light of day in the most recent decade, and particularly noteworthy is the surge in publications following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for approximately 19% of the total.. The graphical representation in Figure 2 provides a visual insight into the fact that a mere 2% of these studies are centered around the subject of autism. Zooming in on the domain of autism, the data depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4 reveal that, since 1992, a remarkable 391 studies have been produced on this subject. A considerable majority of these studies, (73%), have been published within the last decade. Furthermore, a significant 129 studies have been generated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, constituting 33% of the total in this time frame. However, when we narrow our focus even further and zero in on those studies that specifically explore the intersection of autism and artificial intelligence (AI), the number is substantially reduced. In its entirety, only 23 studies have been published in this area. Out of these, 10 have emerged in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, while 21 have surfaced within the last ten years (as presented in Figure 5).
Autism, as a neurodevelopmental disorder, affects social behavior, communication, and interaction. It manifests itself with difficulties in understanding other people’s emotions, in verbal and non-verbal communication, in restricted interest in certain topics, and in the repetitiveness of behaviors and routines. Each autistic individual is unique in his or her characteristics and level of functioning [48]. This uniqueness is reflected in the difficulty of diagnosis and therapy [49,50], which requires a multi-faceted approach from different medical disciplines, and in treatment that increasingly highlights the need for personalized medicine dedicated to autism [51,52].

It can unequivocally be asserted that a sound approach to addressing autism hinges upon the seamless interplay between the domains of diagnosis and therapy, encompassing a multitude of key players, ranging from parental associations and diverse professionals to scientific organizations (Figure 6):

If we focus on the autism diagnosis we can affirm that among the important activities in diagnosis we find [49,50]: -Observation and Interviews: -Physical Exam and Medical History: -Developmental Assessment and Screening: -Psychological and Psychomotor Evaluation: -Assessment of Social Behavior and Social Interactions: -Language and Communication Assessment: -Sensory Assessment-Functional Behavior Assessment. -Genetic, metabolic, biochemical, immunological, neurobiologal assessments-Environmental factors. -Medical Imaging assessment. There are various therapies and interventions used in the treatment of ASD. These therapies aim to address the unique challenges and needs of individuals with autism. Therapies may include medications.
If we focus on the autism therapy we can affirm that some of the most commonly used non medication therapies include [51]: -Behavioral Therapies: -Communication and Speech Therapies. -Speech-Language Therapy-Occupational Therapy. -Social Skills Training-Sensory Integration Therapy. -Educational Interventions-Medication. -Alternative and Complementary Therapies. It’s important to note that the choice of therapy or intervention depends on the individual’s specific needs, strengths, and challenges [52,53]. A comprehensive and individualized treatment plan is often the most effective approach, and it should be developed in consultation with healthcare professionals, including speech therapists, occupational therapists, and behavioral specialists, to provide the best possible support for individuals with autism. There are also available programs that provide training and support for parents and caregivers to help them better understand and manage the challenges associated with autism.
ATs (including AAC) devices occupy a central and strategic position in a multitude of non-medical therapies, as highlighted. However, adhering to the expansive framework established by the WHO [54], which encompasses AT processes and related services, including telemedicine, it becomes evident that ATs possess considerable untapped potential, even within the realm of diagnostic activities.

Our review, through two perspectives (one focused on reviews and the other on scientific articles), has addressed the introduction of AI in assistive technologies for autism.

The initial perspective, cantered on comprehensive reviews, underscores a steadily escalating integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within assistive technologies (ATs) for autism, spanning across fields like robotics [27,30,32], applications [29], and, in a broader context, automated machines such as computers and ICT devices [26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. This integration is specifically geared towards the enhancement of communication, interaction, and, most importantly, the overall social development of autistic children. Notably, in the case of mobile applications, a set of valuable recommendations has been proposed as well [29].

The second perspective consistently underscores a fascinating and rapidly growing integration of AI with robotics in the context of autism [33,38,41,44,45,46]. This integration serves as vital support for enhancing communication, interaction, and social engagement. Furthermore, the strategic aspect of therapy dosage in the realm of autism has been explored across various domains [36]. There’s a burgeoning interest in the deployment of customized wearable devices, such as smart glasses [39,42], designed to improve socio-emotional behaviors in students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with their tolerability also undergoing assessment.

Across all of these research works, as seen in the perspective on reviews, AI is consistently addressed within the domain of automated machines, including computers and ICT devices [33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47]. In a particular study [36], as we had hoped for, the use of assistive technologies (ATs) in the field of diagnosis is highlighted, specifically the automation of ASD diagnosis through the application of machine learning techniques.

What emerges from the review is undoubtedly an early-phase landscape, particularly highlighted by the modest numbers evident at this stage in the field. Consequently, as expected, researchers are currently dedicating relatively little attention to aspects related to integration with the health domain, such as regulatory and consent issues.

Furthermore, it doesn’t seem that there is a strong focus on personalized medicine within the realm of AI in assistive technologies. Personalized medicine, also known as precision medicine or personalized medicine, could represent an innovative approach in the field of autism [55]. This approach would carefully consider individual differences, including genetics, lifestyle, and environment, with the aim of personalizing disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment with the aim of maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects [56,57,58], while also integrating with AI [59,60]. In the specific context of autism, personalized medicine could seek to adapt treatments based on the specific genetic and biological characteristics of each individual suffering from ASD [61]. This could mean identifying specific subtypes of autism based on genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological markers. This customization would allow for a more accurate diagnosis and personalized assessment of each patient’s clinical picture, helping to identify the most suitable and effective treatments [62,63,64].

It will unquestionably be imperative to exert additional efforts in these directions. Undoubtedly, AI is poised to play an ever more pivotal role in interconnecting diverse realms, and the integration of ATs with AI stands to assume an increasingly vital role as a connector of paramount importance

AI’s impact on autism research is substantial, with a growing interest in its applications [65,66,67]. From diagnostics to IoT integrations, AI’s transformative influence spans various healthcare facets, marking a remarkable evolution [68,69]. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning, especially in neural networks, play pivotal roles in addressing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) challenges [65]. ML excels in early ASD detection via behavioral and physiological data analysis, while predictive modeling tailors support strategies [66]. Naturalistic behavioral analysis, powered by computer vision and ML, informs interventions by decoding subtle cues [69]. Deep learning contributes to understanding communication challenges and identifying genetic markers associated with autism [65]. AI promises transformative potential in ASD research, from early detection to personalized interventions, exemplifying technology’s capacity to improve lives [65,66,67,68,69].

In [70], 11 systematic reviews [28,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80] focused on the impact of AI on autism. Collectively, these reviews tell a compelling story of AI emerging as a powerful ally in autism research. Themes explored include precision psychiatry [71], virtual reality-based techniques for health improvement [72], bibliometric analysis of AI in autism treatment [73], hybridization of medical tests [74], triage and priority-based healthcare diagnosis [75], mobile and wearable AI in child and adolescent psychiatry [76], robot-assisted therapy [28], machine-learning models in behavioral assessment [77], deep learning in psychiatric disorders classification [78], the impact of technology on ASD [79], and deep learning in neurology [80]. Each systematic review contributes to a nuanced exploration of AI within the realm of autism research, shedding light on technology’s intersections with neurodevelopmental disorders. These reviews collectively underscore how AI is becoming integral in understanding and supporting individuals on the autism spectrum, offering diverse insights into tailored interventions, holistic well-being, diagnostic strategies, and advancements in neurology. Some of these themes have connections with assistive technologies (ATs). The proposed overview can serve as both a valuable contribution and a mediator and connector between some of these fields.

4.4. Reflections on the Limitations
The review indirectly highlights that integration of AI with assistive technologies in the context of autism presents several challenges that merit careful consideration. Firstly, the inherent diversity within the autism spectrum poses a significant limitation. The spectrum encompasses a broad range of characteristics, making it difficult to develop AI solutions that adequately address the unique needs of each individual. A one-size-fits-all approach may fall short in providing meaningful support. Moreover, the highly individualized nature of autism complicates the effectiveness of AI interventions. Each person with autism has distinct preferences, strengths, and challenges that evolve over time. AI technologies may struggle to keep pace with these individualized requirements, potentially limiting their utility. Ethical considerations also loom large in the integration of AI. The collection and analysis of personal information to tailor interventions raises concerns about privacy, consent, and the potential for data misuse. Striking a balance between leveraging data for customization and respecting ethical boundaries is crucial. A fundamental aspect of autism support is human connection and empathetic understanding. AI, by its very nature, lacks the ability to establish genuine emotional connections. This deficit in emotional support may impede the effectiveness of AI-based interventions, particularly for individuals who require a more empathetic touch. Additionally, user acceptance and comfort pose significant challenges. Individuals with autism may face difficulties adapting to or feeling comfortable with AI technologies. Overcoming resistance and ensuring user comfort are paramount to the successful integration of AI with assistive technologies. Overall, while the integration of AI with AT holds promise, navigating the limitations requires a nuanced approach. Addressing the diversity within the spectrum, recognizing the individualized nature of autism, and upholding ethical standards are essential for the meaningful and ethical use of AI in supporting individuals with autism.

4.5. Reflection on the Broader Implications
The review also shows that the integration of AI with ATs for individuals with autism introduces broader implications that encompass issues of bias, ethics, and cybersecurity. Concerns related to bias arise from the potential replication of societal biases within the AI algorithms. If the training data used is not representative or contains inherent biases, the AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes and fail to address the diverse needs of individuals on the autism spectrum. Ethical considerations become paramount, particularly concerning privacy and informed consent. The customization of interventions based on personal data necessitates a clear understanding and explicit consent from individuals with autism and their caregivers. Ensuring transparency in decision-making processes and providing individuals with the ability to comprehend and challenge those decisions are ethical imperatives. Equity and accessibility issues emerge as the integration of AI may not guarantee equal access to interventions. This raises ethical concerns about the potential exacerbation of existing disparities, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations that ensure the inclusivity and accessibility of AI benefits for all individuals with autism. Turning to cybersecurity, the sensitive nature of the data involved in autism support systems becomes a focal point. The risk of cyberattacks targeting personal information, communication patterns, and behavioral data underscores the importance of robust data security measures to safeguard the privacy and well-being of individuals with autism. Moreover, vulnerabilities to malicious exploitation of AI systems need careful attention. Tampering with interventions, manipulating data, or using AI tools to harm individuals with autism are potential risks that demand proactive measures to secure AI technologies and prevent exploitation. The interconnected nature of AI and AT systems introduces cybersecurity challenges. A breach in one system could have cascading effects on others, potentially compromising the well-being and privacy of individuals with autism. Establishing a secure and resilient infrastructure becomes imperative to mitigate these interconnected cybersecurity risks. Overall, while the integration of AI with assistive technologies holds promise for individuals with autism, addressing biases, upholding ethical standards, and ensuring robust cybersecurity measures are critical for the responsible and beneficial use of AI in enhancing the lives of those on the autism spectrum. Striking a delicate balance between innovation and ethical considerations is paramount to navigating these complex implications.
